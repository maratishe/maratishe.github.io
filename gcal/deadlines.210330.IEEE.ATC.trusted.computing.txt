Advances in technologies and our society will also result in an integration of our real, cyber, and virtual worlds to form smart, and cyber-physical socially aware and integrated hyper worlds. Underpinning such worlds are advanced computing (AC) infrastructure and trusted computing (TC) applications and services. For example, a robust and resilient AC infrastructure can support TC applications and services, in order to provide secure and/or privacy-preserving communications, as well as ensuring computing and communication systems and services are available, predictable, accountable, controllable, assessable, sustainable, dependable, persistent, and secure.



The 18th IEEE International Conference on Advanced and Trusted Computing (ATC 2021), building on the previous successes in Leicester, UK (2019), Guangzhou, China (2018), San Francisco, USA (2017), Toulouse, France (2016), Beijing, China (2015), Bali, Indonesia (2014), Vietri sul Mare, Italy (2013), Fukuoka, Japan (2012), Banff, Canada (2011), Xi'an, China (2010), Brisbane, Australia (2009), Oslo, Norway (2008), Hong Kong, China (2007), Wuhan, China (2006), is proud to be in the 18th consecutive conference year. The aim of the ATC 2021 is to solicit and present state-of-the-art advances in the design and application of advanced computing (AC) infrastructure and trusted computing (TC) applications and services. Specifically, researchers, experts, and scholars from both industry and academia are strongly encouraged to share their recent studies, investigations, and findings in this collaborative and interactive forum.
