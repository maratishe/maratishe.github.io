***Call for Papers***



The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.



The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.



TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications.  We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



- Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification

- Use of data analytics, data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning in network measurement and analysis

- Use of big data, high-rate processing and data reduction in network measurement, analysis and visualization

- Measurements of data centers or cloud-based systems

- Measurements of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Virtual Network Functions (VNF)

- Measurements of home, mobile and wireless traffic including devices with multiple network paths

- Application-layer measurements, including web services, social networks, mobile applications

- Measurements of quality of service and quality of experience, for network services using audio, video, virtual/augmented reality and gaming

- Measurements of network performance and network structure

- Measurement of traditional and new protocols (e.g. TCP, MPTCP, HTTP/2, QUIC) and modes of communication (e.g. NFC and IoT)

- Measurements on testbeds, experimental networks or prototype networks

- Platforms for measurement, troubleshooting, management, and control of operational networks

- Simulation and modelling for network measurements, analysis and visualization

- Identification and classification of traffic, including encrypted and proprietary protocols

- Techniques for and implications of privacy preservation, enhancement and anonymization in the context of traffic measurements

- Applications of traffic analysis for security, anomaly/vulnerability/attack detection and user profiling/privacy

- Current and emerging regulatory frameworks for measurement, analysis and privacy

- Validation and repeatability of measurements, shared datasets, collaborative platforms

***Submission Guidelines***



Authors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. Submissions must not exceed 8 pages in IEEE 2-column style, including references.

Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for LaTeX or MS Word at https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html.



If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b, and use the preamble: 

Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10 point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b.



If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size).



Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper electronically, in Portable Document Format (PDF). The review process is double-blind, hence do not include authors' names and affiliations in the article. Papers must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers.



Submissions that do not comply with all requirements above will be rejected without further review.



Papers must be submitted at https://hotcrp.info.ucl.ac.be/tma2021/, by creating a personal account. The article metadata, including title, up-to-250-word abstract, and authors list, must be provided before the paper registration deadline.



Papers accepted for presentation will be published in the IFIP Open Digital Library, with open access, see
http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/tma/
