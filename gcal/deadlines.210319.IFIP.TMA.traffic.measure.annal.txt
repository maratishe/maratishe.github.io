***Call for Papers***



The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.



The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.



TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications.  We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



- Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification

- Use of data analytics, data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning in network measurement and analysis

- Use of big data, high-rate processing and data reduction in network measurement, analysis and visualization

- Measurements of data centers or cloud-based systems

- Measurements of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Virtual Network Functions (VNF)

- Measurements of home, mobile and wireless traffic including devices with multiple network paths

- Application-layer measurements, including web services, social networks, mobile applications

- Measurements of quality of service and quality of experience, for network services using audio, video, virtual/augmented reality and gaming

- Measurements of network performance and network structure

- Measurement of traditional and new protocols (e.g. TCP, MPTCP, HTTP/2, QUIC) and modes of communication (e.g. NFC and IoT)

- Measurements on testbeds, experimental networks or prototype networks

- Platforms for measurement, troubleshooting, management, and control of operational networks

- Simulation and modelling for network measurements, analysis and visualization

- Identification and classification of traffic, including encrypted and proprietary protocols

- Techniques for and implications of privacy preservation, enhancement and anonymization in the context of traffic measurements

- Applications of traffic analysis for security, anomaly/vulnerability/attack detection and user profiling/privacy

- Current and emerging regulatory frameworks for measurement, analysis and privacy

- Validation and repeatability of measurements, shared datasets, collaborative platforms
