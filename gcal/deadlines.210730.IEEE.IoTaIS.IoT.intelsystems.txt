=====================================

It is our great pleasure to welcome you to The 2021 IEEE Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS'2021) . The conference will be held on November 23-24, 2021 as Virtual Event. This conference is organized and sponsored by the IEEE Indonesia  Communication Society Chapter and supported by Telkom University, IEEE IoT Initiative and IPv6 Forum.

Recent developments of Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligence Systems are numerous and very interesting, covering a wide range of areas, such as: transportation, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, smart city and many more. Many new ideas and research results in these fields continues to emerge from time to time. Unfortunately, there only exist a few events in the region with suitable places to present the ideas as well as to exhibit the recent research results of IoT and Intelligence Systems. International Conference on IoT and Intelligence Systems (IoTaIS) intends to provide solutions to the problems above, by providing a forum for meetings of industry players, researchers and academicians, to showcase the latest research results, to collaborate and to share ideas for the advancement of IoT and Intelligence Systems.

This conference will provide an international forum for researchers, academicians, professionals, and students from various engineering fields and with cross-disciplinary interests in IoT and Intelligence Systems to interact and disseminate information on the latest developments. The conference will include technical sessions, tutorials and technology and business panels. You are invited to submit your papers to the conference. After peer review process, accepted papers will be published in the IoTaIS'2021 Conference Proceedings and presented papers will be submitted to IEEE Xplore after each paper is thoroughly reviewed and (if any) satisfactorily modified according to the reviewer comments.
