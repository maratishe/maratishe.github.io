Special Issue Information

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network connecting billions of
physical objects and devices that are capable of sensing and sharing
data between themselves and the Internet. Hence, one of the core goals
of an IoT system is to provide a digital overlay of information over the
physical world, in domains such as industries, smart cities,
transportation, and energy. Thus, sensing and embedded systems are key
enabling technologies for the IoT vision.

The increasing popularity of IoT applications is driving an exponential
growth in connected IoT devices and generated data. As a result, the
current IoT system architectures and communication technologies are
facing significant technical challenges to meet the requirements of
connectivity, scalability, and interoperability, as well as to
efficiently support the transmission and processing of large volumes of
data. Hence, there is a need for new enabling technologies, end-to-end
architectures, and data management platforms. This Special Issue aims to
foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas,
approaches, theories, and practice to resolve the challenging issues
related to the development of IoT ecosystems. Comprehensive review
papers on the emerging research trends in the IoT domain are highly
encouraged.

This special issue belongs to the section “Internet of Things”. Topics
of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Sensor technologies and protocols for IoT systems
- IoT technologies and wireless sensor networks for smart cities and
smart homes
- IoT in 5G and beyond 5G networks
- Edge, fog, and cloud computing architectures for IoT systems
- SDN and NFV solutions for IoT systems
- Mission-critical IoT applications like smart grid, healthcare,
connected vehicles, and so on
- Security, privacy, and trust management in IoT
- IoT solutions for crowdsourcing and crowd-sensing

(https://www.mdpi.com/user/login/). Once you are registered, click here
to go to the submission form
(https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload/?journal=sensors).
Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be
peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the
journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special
issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short
communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short
abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for
announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be
under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference
proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a
single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant
information for submission of manuscripts is available on the
Instructions for Authors
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/instructions) page. Sensors
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/) is an international
peer-reviewed open access semimonthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors
