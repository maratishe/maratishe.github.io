=========================================================================

We are delighted to invite you for the 5th IEEE International
Conference on Fog and Edge Computing to be held in Melbourne,
Australia. The conference will be held as part of and in conjunction
with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society and ACM.


INTRODUCTION
Billions of devices and sensors ranging from user gadgets to more
complex systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, such as power
grids or vehicles, from the physical world are getting connected to
the Internet. However, the need to operate the scale of heterogeneous
devices and sensors while being performance-efficient in real-time is
challenging. Typically, the data generated by the devices and sensors
are transferred to and processed centrally by services hosted on
geographically distant clouds. This is untenable given the
communication latency incurred and the ingress bandwidth demand.

A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry
experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources
located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the
cloud and the edge. These edge resources may be geographically or in
the network topology be closer to devices and sensors, such as home
router, gateways or more substantial micro data centers. Edge
resources may be used to offload selected services from the cloud to
accelerate an application or host edge-native applications. The
paradigm within which the edge is harnessed is referred to as
'Fog/Edge computing'.

The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of
service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing,
and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between
these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources,
which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization
and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management.
Extensions to current programming and storage models are required and
new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel
applications that can benefit from massively distributed and
data-driven systems need to be developed. Addressing security, privacy
and trust of the edge resources is of paramount importance while
managing the resources and context for mobile, transient and hardware
constrained resources. Lastly, emerging domains like autonomous
vehicles and machine/deep learning need to be supported over such
platforms.


CALL FOR PAPERS
The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering
both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific
applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use
the edge. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:
* Data centers and infrastructures for Fog/Edge computing
* Middleware and runtime systems for Fog/Edge infrastructures
* Programming models for Fog/Edge computing
* Storage and data management platforms for Fog/Edge computing
* Scheduling for Fog/Edge infrastructures
* Distributed and federated machine learning on Fog/Edge
* Performance monitoring and metering of Fog/Edge infrastructures
* Legal issues and business aspects of Fog/Edge computing
* Security, privacy, trust and provenance issues in Fog/Edge computing
* Modeling and simulation of Fog/Edge environments
* Novel, latency-sensitive and locality-critical applications of
Fog/Edge computing


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
We invite original manuscripts that have neither been published
elsewhere nor are under review at a different venue. The manuscripts
should be structured as technical papers, written in English. Authors
should submit papers electronically in PDF format and may not exceed 8
letter-size pages in length, including all figures, tables and
references. Papers should follow the IEEE format template for
