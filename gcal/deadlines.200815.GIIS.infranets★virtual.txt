Initially planned in Tunis, Tunisia, GIIS'2020 will run as a fully virtual web-based event, due to the uncertainty raised by the Covid-19 pandemics.

The Global Information Infrastructure and Networking Symposium (GIIS) consists of an interrelated set of technical, policy, and social issues implicit in the development of national and international (global) information infrastructures and networks. GIIS aims at identifying and promoting the exchange of knowledge on these interrelated issues and provides liaison to bodies in the global society, technical fora and international standards. GIIS 2020 follows the success of the precedent editions and intends to promote interdisciplinary conference sessions to discuss, build and further the use of national and international information infrastructures and networks. The conference also aims at providing a forum for the participants to broaden professional contacts and for technical discussions and interactions on specific information infrastructure and networking topics. Information Infrastructure and Networking (IIN) brings together information processing applications, communications networks and services, physical and software elements in networks, and end systems. The program of GIIS 2020 will include invited talks and keynotes, paper presentations, tutorials, panel, and discussion sessions.
