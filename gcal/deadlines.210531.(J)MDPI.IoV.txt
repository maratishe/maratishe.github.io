****************************************************************************



Summary



Recent considerable advancements in the emerging yet promising paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its convergence with the state-of-the-art wireless communication technologies has led to the evolution of conventional vehicular ad hoc networks into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV is primarily an amalgamation of a variety of network entities, i.e., vehicles, vulnerable pedestrians, and supporting roadside infrastructure, and act as a dynamic communication system for facilitating real-time efficient information sharing among these entities in order to guarantee safer navigation and intelligent traffic management. This not only entails vehicle-to-vehicle communication but also takes into consideration vehicle-to-human, vehicle-to-road, and vehicle-to-sensor interactions. Hence, recently, the notion of IoV is being explored by researchers and scientists from both academia and industry, nevertheless, significant developments from a wide variety of technological facets still need to be materialized so as to unleash the true potential of IoV in the realm of intelligent transportation system which itself is integral to the evolution of futuristic smart and connected cities.


This special issue, accordingly, welcome original contributions so as to bring forth the state-of-the-art advancements in the IoV landscape. Both high-quality survey and technical contributions are welcome for this special issue.



Topics include but are not limited to:



Promising architectures and protocols for IoV
Emerging communication technologies for IoV (DSRC, mmWave, Terahertz, etc.)
Security and privacy issues in IoV
Machine learning-based techniques/algorithms for IoV
Software-defined approaches in IoV
Blockchain-enabled IoV
Trust and reputation management in IoV
Leveraging fog and edge computing in IoV
Intelligent resource management in IoV
Quality-of-service and quality-of-experience in IoV
Social IoV
