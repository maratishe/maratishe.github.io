=========================================================================================================  
Workshop on Cloud Continuum Services for Smart IoT Systems (CCIoT)  


Call for Papers  


Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the hottest topic in the field of communications and computing. Many cloud providers offers cloud/edge services for IoT, to handle big data, to apply AI technologies, to support massive IoT devices, and to provide low-latency control.

About the Workshop:  
Cooperative vehicular networking is widely acknowledged as a key enabler of the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), known as Cooperative-ITS. The range of application of C-ITS is very large, including driving assistance - cooperative awareness, cooperative intersection management, cooperative platoon control, etc. Thanks to V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) communication technology, all ITS actors (vehicles, infrastructure and other road users) can cooperatively exchange real time information, leading to increasing levels of safety and efficiency. The V2X technology combines different communication technologies, from short and medium range ad-hoc direct communication to 3G/4G (future 5G) cellular network communication to realize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-person (V2P) network connections. Developing C-ITS applications has to cope with many challenges, related to control theory and signal processing as well as wireless communication. C-ITS applications impose different requirements in terms of latency, throughput, reliability on the network and safety of the V2X environment.  


The CVNET workshop intends to cover all aspects of vehicular communication technologies and cooperative V2X systems. It aims to bring together engineers and scientists from both academia and industry to exchange ideas and foster discussion about the main challenges facing the deployment of C-ITS. The topics are not only limited to vehicular networks but also include applications of intelligent transportation systems, safety systems, connected vehicles and telematics.  


Workshop Topics:  
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  
Cooperative V2X communication  
Routing and protocols for cooperative V2X systems  
Big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence technologies for V2X  
Vehicular networks and systems management  
Cross-layer design and optimization for vehicular networks  
Security and privacy issues in vehicular communication environment

In today’s scenario, each individual faces substantial complications relating to transportation systems such as congestion, vehicle parking difficulties, pollution caused by an increased level of carbon dioxide emission, longer traveling times, road accidents, etc. These consequences are due to the rising number of vehicular systems and rapid urbanization processes. This leads to the development of modern technologies such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANET), VANET cloud (VC), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Among all these techniques, IoV remains the most prominent and emerging one. IoV is a series of interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other through a common public network. It is a highly integrated application of two major domains IoT and ITS. The communication across the IoV network includes three different types: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P).  


Smart vehicles with progressive communication abilities do not only communicate with broadcast and navigation satellites but also with various smart devices such as roadside units, smart vehicles, and passenger smartphones. Since IoV has widespread interconnected networks with numerous users, there is an increased risk of security and privacy measures. These security and privacy concerns may lead to serious consequences if they are not addressed and dealt with in an appropriate manner. Thus, advanced security measures for IoV systems have become the most essential requirement.  


This special issue focuses mainly on the development of various cybersecurity mechanisms for IoV systems with improved security and privacy features. Further, it seeks to bring together the various researchers and industry people from different fields of computer science to contribute novel and effective cyber-security solutions for security protection in IoV systems.  


Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:  


Security and Privacy in IoV using cyber-security mechanisms  
Enhanced cybersecurity mechanisms for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication in IoV  
Novel and efficient frameworks for improving trust based secure communication in IoV  
Secure Cloud assisted cyber-security mechanisms for IoV  
Trust based security algorithms for Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV)  
Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV): Architecture, security, privacy and future directions  
Security protocols for various applications of IoV using cyber-security  
Protection and management of cyber-security across critical IoV systems  
Secure Authentication and access control mechanisms for IoV using cybersecurity  
Novel and improved cybersecurity solutions for IoV in smart cities

Aims and Scope  


Social network (SN) is a social structure and it is the combination of networks and graph theory. A SN contains two major parameters, viz. nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the edges, ties or links (interactions or relationships) that connect nodes. In SNs, social structures are visualized, e.g. friendship and acquaintance networks, social media networks, business networks, information circulation, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, disease transmission, collaboration graphs, kinship, sexual relationships, etc. These networks are sometimes visualized using sociograms where nodes are represented by points and edges are represented by lines. Now-a-days a huge amount of people are using SN throughout the globe and hence social network analysis becomes an important issue and it is a key technique in modern sociology. The mobile and Internet technologies have been the primary force behind the rise of social media, providing technological platforms for information dissemination, interactive communications, content generation etc.  


Analysis of SN is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines, e.g. data aggregation and mining, network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, social sharing and filtering, recommender systems development, and link prediction and entity resolution, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, information system development analysis, marketing, and business intelligence needs, development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use, community-based problem solving and many more.  


Today, consumers constantly interact with social media. Companies are very eager to take advantage of our constant engagement with platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. As a result, a growing number are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in social media to better connect with potential customers. Just a single click can impact what notifications pop up on our social media accounts, viz. posts, advertisements, friend suggestions, and more due to the use of AI.  






This special issue focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to develop and manage SN. The aim of this special issue is provide a forum in which to publish state-of-the-art articles for development, security, management, etc. of SN.

Special Issue Information  


Dear Colleagues,  


Information hiding techniques and network covert channels are becoming  
fundamental to assess the security characteristics of the Internet. On  
the one hand, they can be used as offensive tools to empower malware,  
for instance, to bypass security policies of infected nodes, to secretly  
exfiltrate data towards remote command and control facilities, or to  
orchestrate a botnet or launch an attack without being detected by  
de-facto standard security tools. On the other hand, information hiding  
and network covert channels can be used to enforce copyright of digital  
artifacts via watermarking, trace network flows for traffic engineering  
purposes, and implement privacy enhancing services. From this  
perspective, this Special Issue aims at collecting new work addressing  
different aspects of information hiding and network covert channels.  


Authors are invited to submit original work on (but not limited to) the  
following topics:  


Model detection techniques and the mitigation of information  
hiding-capable threats;  
Colluding application attacks and exfiltration techniques;  
New mechanisms to orchestrate botnets and hide data exfiltration;  
Novel detection techniques for network covert channels, with an emphasis  
on scalability;  
Advanced network covert channels, for instance, those leveraging  
reversible steganographic methods;

Background  


With the digital revolution, edge analytics along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become important parts of our lives and are getting tremendous attention from industry, academia, governments, and from the smart connected living community as a whole. The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the true vision of the connected world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected living services, computation becomes more intensive and storage burden increases at each edge device. To address these challenges, AI-powered edge computing provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, at a level that is impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-AI (edge analytics driven by AI) has the capability to self-learn from data, understand patterns, optimize, make predictions, and provide fresh insights to stakeholders of connected living for better decisions with improved Quality of Services (QoS). Even though researchers have been making advances in AI and edge data analytics individually, relatively less attention has been given to build a cost-effective edge-AI driven connected living ecosystem while considering many aspects of its algorithms, communications, offloading, caching, architectures, framework, and services. Even today, many technical challenges need to be addressed in this convergence of edge-AI driven connected living paradigm.  


The aim of this special issue is to bring academic researchers and industry developers together for sharing the recent advances and future trends of AI-driven edge intelligence for connected living. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


Explainable AI (XAI) and predictive edge analytics for infectious diseases such as COVID-19  
Edge AI-assisted COVID-19 and similar infectious disease detection or diagnosis systems  
AI-centric Mobile Edge Computing approach for Connected Living  
AI-enabled IoT-edge data analytics for Connected Living  
AI-enabled edge data fusion for Connected Living  
ML-driven edge approach to Connected Living  
AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning based networked applications, techniques and testbeds for Connected Living  
AI-driven multi access edge computing approach for Connected Living  
New opportunities, challenges, case studies, and applications of Edge-AI for Connected Living  
Security, Privacy, and Trust of Edge-AI for Connected Living

Network Softwarization and Management Series  




=====================================================================================  


This series focuses on softwarization, management, and their integration in communication networks and  
their services. “Network softwarization” advocates for architectures that separate the software implementing  
network functions, protocols and services from the hardware running them. Propelled by the maturity of  
technologies like network function virtualization and software-defined networking, softwarization is radically  
changing the way communication infrastructures are designed and operated enabling rapid and innovative  
service creation. “Network management“ is about administering networks and supporting their operations.  
It aims to integrate fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security management in the network;  
to leverage the self-management, automation and autonomic capabilities of networks, and to move from a  
“managed object” paradigm to a “management by objective” one.  


The key role that software and management are increasingly playing in telecommunications is enabling  
unprecedented levels of abstraction, disaggregation, operation, integration, and programmability in  
network infrastructures and services. This Series publishes in-depth, cutting-edge, articles on state-  
of-the-art technologies and solutions bringing together the latest advances, innovations, open-source

MDPI Sensors - Special Issue  


Bluetooth Low Energy: Advances and Applications  
[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BLE](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BLE)  


Call for Papers  


Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was first specified in 2010. Since then, its  
popularity has not ceased to increase. In fact, BLE has become the  
dominant low-power wireless technology in a variety of consumer  
electronics devices, including the smartphone. The latter is crucially  
important, as it brings widespread presence to BLE. This feature of BLE,  
along with its suitability for simple, energy-constrained devices (e.g.,  
battery-enabled sensors), allows positioning BLE as a fundamental enabler  
of networking paradigms such as wireless sensor networks and the Internet  
of Things.  


BLE technology and BLE-based networking have also expanded in parallel to  
their success. The panoply of BLE features, options, and mechanisms has  
significantly increased in the last few years. Significant additions to  
the BLE universe include several Bluetooth specification updates (the  
latest being Bluetooth 5.2), IPv6 support for BLE devices,  
and many initiatives for enabling BLE mesh networks.  


BLE applications can be found in a wide range of domains, e.g., smart  
home, smart cities, smart health, smart agriculture, or Industry 4.0. BLE  
is enabling the interaction between humans and smart objects, as well as  
between smart objects themselves. BLE has also been leveraged for  
innovative location-based applications, opportunistic data collection,  
crowd-sensing, etc.  


Remarkably, BLE is also playing a fundamental role in the context of  
combatting COVID-19. BLE-enabled sensors are being used in hospitals to  
remotely collect vital parameter readings (e.g. temperature, blood  
pressure, etc.), minimizing the risk of infection for medical personnel.  
Furthermore, the widespread presence of BLE in smartphones is crucial to  
enable contact tracing applications being developed and used worldwide.  


This Special Issue aims at collecting high quality research papers and  
review articles focusing on recent advances in BLE. Original, high-quality  
contributions that have not been published before and are not currently  
under review by other journals or conferences are sought.  


Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


- Performance evaluation (e.g., mathematical analysis, simulation and/or  
experimentation) of BLE networks.  
- BLE version-oriented studies (Bluetooth 4.x, Bluetooth 5.x).  
- Internet connectivity of BLE devices: 6LoWPAN/6Lo, gateway-based  
approaches, etc.  
- BLE mesh networking standardization efforts: Bluetooth Mesh (Bluetooth  
SIG), IPv6 mesh over BLE (IETF), etc.  
- Novel approaches to BLE mesh networks.  
- Coexistence of BLE with other wireless technologies.  
- BLE beacons.  
- BLE-based localization.  
- BLE-based opportunistic sensor data collection.  
- Innovative applications of BLE in smart home, smart cities, smart  
transportation, smart agriculture, smart health, Industry 4.0, etc.  
- Applications of BLE for combatting COVID-19: parameter monitoring, contact  
tracing, etc.

-----------------------------------  


Submission Deadline: October 15, 2020  


Dear Colleagues:  


We cordially invite you to share your latest research results by submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management Special Issue on "Latest Developments for Security Management of Networks and Services".  


------------------------  
CALL FOR PAPERS  
------------------------  


As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.  


These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.  


IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services. We welcome submissions addressing the important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!

Special issue on  


Cybersecurity Management in the era of AI  


[https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838](https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838)  


***Submissions due: October 31st, 2020***  


We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.  


Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.  


Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.  


This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI. The Special Issue also welcomes contributions from the industry perspective. Topics of interest include, but they are not limited to:

Software: Practice and Experience  


50th Anniversary (Golden Jubilee) Celebration  
Special Issue on:  
Software Systems and Innovations Journey from 1970-2020  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x)  


=========================================================================  


Call for Papers:  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------  


The first issue of "Software: Practice and Experience", published in  
1971, reported on applications that could be described in a few thousand  
lines of code; today, software systems are among the most complex  
entities produced by humans. This growth has spawned new development  
methodologies and exposed serious systemic weaknesses.  


Over the last 50 years, our most pressing problems have moved from the  
seven development issues that David Barron focused on in his inaugural  
editorial to issues brought about by the scope and ubiquity of our  
current applications: Software systems must now be resistant to attack  
by malicious agents, and must operate successfully with improper inputs.  
Cyber-physical systems must avoid entering states that would damage  
equipment or harm people. Applications built as a collection of  
cooperating processes must be able to deliver results in a timely  
manner, even when the number of simultaneous users fluctuates  
significantly. Whether or not these issues can be dealt with by current  
design methodology is an open question. Regardless of the answer,  
however, Barron's vision for the journal as a venue for authors to  
present their work in a form that will be useful to others remains valid  
as we move into the next 50 years.  


We invite high quality papers that discuss the development of new ideas,  
models, paradigms, and systems evolution appropriate to the challenges  
facing the field today. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
* Threat models for software systems  
* Performance improvement in distributed systems  
* Scalability of software  
* User interface design  
* Workflow management  
* Application Programming Models and Environments  
* Advances in systems software powering embedded devices to  
large-scale computing environments  
* Internet-driven Innovative Applications

=======================  




IMPORTANT DATES  
----------------------  
Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.  


SCOPE AND TOPICS  
----------------------  
During the last decade, 5G technology has been developed and successfully commercialized for mobile communication networks. 5G technology supports enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication, massive machine type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT), devices and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical devices with IMT-2020 standard aims.  


Some key technologies, such as 5G numerology with new radio (NR) waveform in sub- or above 6 GHz (mmWave) bands and MIMO with beamforming, allow those heterogeneous devices or services to overcome their own challenging scenarios. Still, 5G access technology has further challenges, as it is now evolving with convergence technologies, such as autonomously driven vehicles, smart factories, satellite or UAS, public safety, etc. This 5G+ demands more bandwidth, connectivity, and reliability.  


Wireless communications in the Terahertz (THz) frequency band and unlicensed bands such as private 5G are considered to provide ultra-high user data rates. Further, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been explored for spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. V2X communication using mmWave side-links is not under-standardized. 5G and 6G now consider interoperation of GEO or LEO satellites and UAS to control autonomous vehicles, including drones, and provide wide-area cells for public safety or content broadcast. This nationwide cell can improve reliability and service continuity. As 5G+ pursues more than low-latency end-to-end access delay (<1 ms), mobile edge computing (MEC) has received attention in terms of supporting the requirements of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) to improve performance.  


This Special Issue will present the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 5G access communication and its evolution. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit their original manuscripts.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- Sub- or above 6 GHz radio access technologies for 5G+  
- V2X communication using mmWave links  
- NOMA for 5G and beyond wireless networks  
- THz communications for 5G+ eMBB  
- Fog and MEC architecture for 5G access networks  
- Machine learning aided Fog and MEC operation  
- (Massive) multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) for a 5G+ access network  
- Network function virtualization (NFV) and hardware acceleration for data plane processing of 5G access traffic  
- Traffic measurements and analysis (control and data plane) of 5G access networks  
- SDN-assisted control plane in 5G access networks  
- Multi-connectivity and co-existence in satellite/UAS and a 5G network  
- Private 5G access network by dynamic spectrum access (DSA)  
- Localization issue in indoor or city canyon

Dear colleagues  


Please, consider submitting a paper to the Special Issue "Spatio-Temporal Models and Geo-Technologies"  
of the ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information (see motivations and topics of interest below).  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 15 December 2020.

-------------  


Motivations  
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;  


- Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;  


- Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;  


- Graph-based representations to space and time phenomena;  


- Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning;  


- Multiscale modelling;  


- Combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;  


- Spatiotemporal query languages within GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal GIS interfaces;  


- Temporal indoor GIS;  


- Location-based time GIS;  


- Real-time GIS;  


- Temporal web and wireless GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal technologies;  


- Spatiotemporal urban and environmental GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal semantic web;  


- Spatiotemporal data mining.

Applied Energy (Impact Factor 8.848) - Special Issue on "Energy Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Network – Moving towards Real Implementation"  






Over the last few years, there has been extensive growth in small-scale distributed energy resources (DER), which encompass behind-the-meter generation, energy storage, inverters, electric vehicles, and controllable loads at the household level. These small-scale resources can be utilized not only to manage the energy demand more efficiently but also to enable a significant mix of clean energy into the grid. However, to do so, it is important for the owners of these assets to actively participate in the energy market. As a consequence, peer-to-peer trading has emerged as a next-generation energy management technique for the smart grid that can enable the owners of small scale DERs - also known as prosumers - to actively participate in the energy market. With the prosumers in control of setting the terms of transactions and the delivery of goods and services, it is expected that the gain that the prosumers can reap from participating in peer-to-peer trading would be substantial. At the same time, the grid — consisting of generators, retailers, and distribution network system providers — can also obtain a significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand, lowering investment and operational costs, minimizing reserve requirements, and improving power system reliability.  






As a result, a large number of studies have been reported on peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks over the past few years. These studies have focused on a number of important decision-making problems of participants in the virtual layer as well as investigated the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on the physical distribution network. A large number of pilot projects have also been established in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, interestingly, there has been no indication of the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the actual energy market in any country. The purpose of this special section is to address this gap by publishing findings from innovative research that have the potential to establish peer-to-peer sharing in today’s electricity market as an energy trading mechanism. The published articles will demonstrate a set of new research outcomes that can successfully decide on energy trading parameters that are beneficial not only for the prosumers but also for other stakeholders within the market. At the same time, transacted energy by prosumers over the physical layer will not detrimentally impact the physical power system network in terms of violating any constraints and increasing the loss significantly.  






The targeted audience includes both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The purpose of the special issue is to provide a platform to enhance interdisciplinary research and share the most recent ideas in the above-related fields. In particular, the published article would cover, but not limited to, the following topics of energy system via designing new peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms:  


· Electricity market regulation  


· Sharing of energy storage  


· Providing demand flexibility to the grid  


· Trading of renewable energy in microgrid  


· Designing prosumer engagement plans  


· Modelling flexibility of distributed energy resources  


· Providing voltage and frequency regulation service  


· Pricing model  


· Minimizing of network loss

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Deadline: 31 December 2020  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC)  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.  


This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.  


Possible topics include but are not limited to:  


Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;  
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;  
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;  
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;  
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);  
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;  
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;  
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;  
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;  
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFECcommunications;  
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19  






Brief description/Scope  






COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).  


Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues  


Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable  
development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving,  
intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and  
enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the  
construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning  
of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the  
sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization.  
Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide  
alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not  
available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming  
5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the  
massive MIMO technique.  


This Special Issue aims to highlight advances in all aspects of  
high-precision positioning in intelligent transportation systems for  
different objects, including land vehicles, pedestrians, unmanned aerial  
vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles, considering GNSS signals, ground  
signals, and their combinations. Up-to-date reviews and original works are  
both accepted in this issue. Topics include but are not limited to:  


* Multi-GNSS receivers and emerging navigation satellite  
systems;  


* Design, prototyping, and testing of positioning devices;  


* Detection and mitigation techniques for adverse propagation  
conditions;  


* 5G Positioning;  


* Multisensor fusion;  


* Cooperative localization;  


* LiDAR Odometry;  


* Visual Odometry;  


* Simultaneous localization and mapping;  


* Positioning with HD maps.
