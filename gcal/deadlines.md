=====================================================  
Special Session on  
Intelligent Edge Learning for Industrial IoT  
in conjunction with  
IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)  
Kyoto Japan, 20-23 June 2021  
[https://www.isie2021.org/index.html](https://www.isie2021.org/index.html)  
=====================================================  
(Supported by IEEE IES Technical Committee on Cloud and Wireless Systems for Industrial Applications)  


On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is our great honor to invite all delegates, representatives, and participants from all around the world to take part in the 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), held 20-23 June 2021 in Kyoto, Japan. The ISIE annually gathers industry experts, researchers, and academics to share ideas and experiences surrounding frontier technologies, breakthroughs, innovative solutions, research results, and initiatives related to industrial electronics and their applications.  


In case the author cannot come to Kyoto due to this pandemic, we will offer an option for remote (online) presentations.  


Further information will be updated on this website at a later date.  


The main theme of ISIE2021 is SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Especially “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, and “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”.  


Moreover, the year “2021” is the 70th anniversary of IES. ISIE2021 will have “the commemorative event of 70th anniversary of IES”. Please enjoy and contribute to the 70th-anniversary events in ISIE2021!  




Scope of the Session:  
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!  
ssion is to provide a forum for sci  
entists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-progress on all aspects of intelligent edge learning for industrial IoT.  




Topics of interest:  
o Edge, fog, and mobile edge computing for Industrial IoT  
o Machine learning and computational intelligence for handling big data in Industrial applications  
o Information-centric networking and software-defined network for edge intelligence  
o Intelligent edge-based mobile computing and analysis  
o Multimedia QoS, and traffic management in industrial networks  
o Real-time communication interfaces and protocols  
o Intelligent infrastructures at the edge  
o Hardware testbed or field trial for AI-driven intelligent edge computing for industrial applications  
o Security and related considerations in intelligent edge computing  
o Intelligent routing and load balancing for edge computing  
o Multiple access technologies for edge computing  
o Network protocols for distributed machine learning

INTELLIGENT & RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD  
[https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/)  
JULY 12-16, 2021  


***CALL FOR PAPERS***  


MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 18, 2021  


Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.  


The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis. Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication. Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely. These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities. But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered. Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently. In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses. As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported. How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing. How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users? For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!  


COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.  


***SUBMISSION***  
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 & C1J2 program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Publishing Policies, and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck portal.

Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation. The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.  


This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:  


Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies  
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems  
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support  
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling  
Medium access control design  
Data centers and cloud systems  
Radio access technology selection  
Spectrum sharing in intra- and inter-tier HetNets  
Traffic load estimation and resource reservation  
User mobility prediction and handover support  
Network fault detection and self-healing  
Network self-configuration and self-organization  
Intrusion detection and self-protection  
Machine learning relevant topics  
Relevant analysis and modelling  
Relevant surveys

JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON  






Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19  




PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021  






Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:  




● Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks  


● AI/ML applied to epidemic data  


● Approaches for resource constrained testing  


● Adaptive interventions  


● Contact tracing  


● Mobile sensing for health monitoring  


● Privacy in E-health  


● Technologies to mitigate misinformation around epidemics

Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;  
Complex systems and networks;  
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;  
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;  
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;  
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;

In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific

proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues,  


GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.  
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.  
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.  
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.  
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.  
Keywords  


GNSS  
Urban applications  
Multipath, NLOS  
Hybridization, multisensor fusion  
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)  
Performance analysis and enhancement  
Integrity concepts  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 28 February 2022.  
Ctrl Publication: Immediate online publication once the paper is accepted.

Dear Colleague,  


Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications (QUESTA) will be hosting a special issue on "Learning and Control in Stochastic Networks" with a submission deadline on March 1, 2021. Details below.  


Background and Scope: The theory of stochastic networks and their control is undergoing a phase of exciting collaborative growth with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, fueled by several new applications.  


On the one hand, recent years have seen a surge of interest in the application of machine learning techniques to the control of stochastic networks arising in modern communications applications like cloud computing and data centers, the goal being to design agile control mechanisms that operate under minimal informational assumptions and that adapt to changes in system characteristics over time.  


On the other hand, stochastic networks have emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm for addressing operational questions of matching demand and supply in modern platforms and marketplaces. Examples include ride-sharing platforms, labor platforms, energy markets, etc. A key value proposition of these platforms is the ability to learn from the tremendous amount of transactional data being generated to predict and mitigate supply-demand imbalances, and to recommend and make higher value matches than would otherwise be possible without centralized recommendations and/or matchmaking. Realizing this value proposition requires network control mechanisms that seamlessly assimilate information from data while being robust to strategic concerns.  


These developments have led to a growing body of literature on the control of stochastic networks with novel architectures and at the interface of these control mechanisms with machine learning and strategic behavior. The special issue invites papers addressing novel technical challenges in this domain with direct applications to practice.

================================  
Scope, Aims, and Topics  
================================  
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.  


Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.  


The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.  


For this special issue to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586) related to the INDIS workshop, we encourage research papers that address one or more of the following networking research challenges; and developments that are essential in the information systems infrastructure for the scientific discovery process. Participants to the workshop are invited to submit extended versions of their accepted papers. We also welcome new paper submissions on related topics.  


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
- Data-intensive distributed application architectures  
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in service of data science applications  
- High-performance data transfer applications and techniques  
- Science DMZs and other campus network architecture constructs  
- Requirements and issues for network quality of service (QoS) or experience (QoE)  
- Multi-domain networking, including hybrid clouds, multi-domain authorization, data sharing, and data privacy  
- Network monitoring and traffic analytics, autonomous network control  
- Network management: diagnostics, troubleshooting, fault management, performance monitoring, configuration management, and scheduling  
- High-performance network protocols and network architectures

=====================================================  
Special Session on  
Intelligent Edge Learning for Industrial IoT  
in conjunction with  
IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)  
Kyoto Japan, 20-23 June 2021  
[https://www.isie2021.org/index.html](https://www.isie2021.org/index.html)  
=====================================================  
(Supported by IEEE IES Technical Committee on Cloud and Wireless Systems for Industrial Applications)  


On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is our great honor to invite all delegates, representatives, and participants from all around the world to take part in the 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), held 20-23 June 2021 in Kyoto, Japan. The ISIE annually gathers industry experts, researchers, and academics to share ideas and experiences surrounding frontier technologies, breakthroughs, innovative solutions, research results, and initiatives related to industrial electronics and their applications.  


In case the author cannot come to Kyoto due to this pandemic, we will offer an option for remote (online) presentations.  


Further information will be updated on this website at a later date.  


The main theme of ISIE2021 is SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Especially “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, and “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”.  


Moreover, the year “2021” is the 70th anniversary of IES. ISIE2021 will have “the commemorative event of 70th anniversary of IES”. Please enjoy and contribute to the 70th-anniversary events in ISIE2021!  




Scope of the Session:  
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!  
ssion is to provide a forum for sci  
entists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-progress on all aspects of intelligent edge learning for industrial IoT.

Special Issue on "Smart Cyberphysical Systems and Cloud–Edge Engineering"  
Information - an Open Access Journal by MDPI  
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Cyberphysical_Cloud_Engineering)  


Dear Colleagues,  


At present, computers, smart sensors and devices are pervasive, and  
computational processes are increasingly becoming transparent to  
humans, making up the very fabric of contemporary societies. In this  
context, the cyberphysical system (CPS) paradigm is thriving. CPS  
refers to the integration of computation with physical processes. A  
CPS uses sensors and actuators to link the computational systems to  
the physical world. Through the instrumentation of the physical world,  
it is possible to monitor several variables and transfer data to  
cyberspace, where applications and services use such data to make  
decisions that affect and control physical processes, in a feedback  
loop. The ultimate goal of this integration is to improve processes,  
making them more effective and optimized, increasing productivity for  
companies and quality of life for citizens.  


The recent advancement of computational intelligence techniques has  
leveraged the new generation of CPS, which is known as smart  
cyberphysical systems (sCPS). sCPS are distributed and  
software-intensive systems that, from heterogeneous data sources, both  
physical and virtual, and from their processing using computational  
intelligence paradigms, are able to efficiently and autonomously  
manage real-world processes. Such systems have the potential to  
optimize and support a wide range of application domains.  


The growing scale, in terms of devices and data, of modern sCPS and  
the need to perform complex processing and provide fast responses  
makes cloud–edge platforms natural candidates for integrating such  
systems. By applying the model and principles of cloud computing to  
sCPS, any virtual or physical device, including sensors and actuators,  
is available as a service and can quickly and autonomously be  
provisioned for usage to meet the user and application demands. By  
leveraging the edge computing paradigm, time constraints of CPS can be  
dealt with.  


In this context, this Special Issue intends to explore the multiple  
aspects of sCPS and the role of cloud–edge computing as an integrating  
and enabling platform for this paradigm. Potential topics of interest  
include but are not limited to the following:  


Cloud/edge/cloud–edge computing and services for cyberphysical systems;  
Resource management in cloud–edge-based sCPS;  
sCPS as a service;  
Design, implementation, and operation of cloud/edge/cloud–edge  
platforms for sCPS;  
Practical design issues in building cloud–edge-based sCPS;  
Managing big data for sCPS;  
Programming models, benchmarks, and tools for cloud-based sCPS;  
Virtualization models for sCPS;  
Architectures and frameworks for sCPS;  
Interoperability issues in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;  
Solutions for reliability and resilience in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;  
Self-adaptation, self-healing, and self-configuration in sCPS;  
Real-time data analytics and data stream processing for sCPS;  
Context-aware event processing for sCPS;  
Internet of Things and real-time services for sCPS;  
Security challenges in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS.

Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.  


The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.  


IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.  


The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.

Empowering Sustainable Energy Infrastructures via AI-assisted Wireless Communications  
IEEE Wireless Communications  
[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy)  


Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.  


Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.  


This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm) FEC  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.  


This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.  


Possible topics include but are not limited to:  


Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;  
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;  
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;  
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;  
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);  
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;  
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;  
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;  
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;  
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;  
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such  
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by  
the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.  
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same  
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing  
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the  
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and  
included in the proceedings.  




Posters and demos  
=================  


WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to  
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.  




Replicability label  
===================  


WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.  
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to  
minimize the overhead of applying for this label.  
The process of reviewing the work for replicability will be largely  
similar to the previous years.  




Double submissions  
==================  


It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,  
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently  
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions  
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals  
involved.  




Workshops and Tutorial  
==================  
ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorial co-organized with the main  
conference. Details will be made available on the website.

succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for  
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available  
on the WiSec 2021 website at [https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.)  


For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge  
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing  
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an  
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or  
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a  
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps  
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such  
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by  
the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.  
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same  
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing  
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the  
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and  
included in the proceedings.

***Call for Papers***  






The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.  






The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.  






TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications. We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.  






Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  






- Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification  


- Use of data analytics, data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning in network measurement and analysis

Applied Energy (Impact Factor 8.848) - Special Issue on "Energy Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Network – Moving towards Real Implementation"  






Over the last few years, there has been extensive growth in small-scale distributed energy resources (DER), which encompass behind-the-meter generation, energy storage, inverters, electric vehicles, and controllable loads at the household level. These small-scale resources can be utilized not only to manage the energy demand more efficiently but also to enable a significant mix of clean energy into the grid. However, to do so, it is important for the owners of these assets to actively participate in the energy market. As a consequence, peer-to-peer trading has emerged as a next-generation energy management technique for the smart grid that can enable the owners of small scale DERs - also known as prosumers - to actively participate in the energy market. With the prosumers in control of setting the terms of transactions and the delivery of goods and services, it is expected that the gain that the prosumers can reap from participating in peer-to-peer trading would be substantial. At the same time, the grid — consisting of generators, retailers, and distribution network system providers — can also obtain a significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand, lowering investment and operational costs, minimizing reserve requirements, and improving power system reliability.  






As a result, a large number of studies have been reported on peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks over the past few years. These studies have focused on a number of important decision-making problems of participants in the virtual layer as well as investigated the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on the physical distribution network. A large number of pilot projects have also been established in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, interestingly, there has been no indication of the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the actual energy market in any country. The purpose of this special section is to address this gap by publishing findings from innovative research that have the potential to establish peer-to-peer sharing in today’s electricity market as an energy trading mechanism. The published articles will demonstrate a set of new research outcomes that can successfully decide on energy trading parameters that are beneficial not only for the prosumers but also for other stakeholders within the market. At the same time, transacted energy by prosumers over the physical layer will not detrimentally impact the physical power system network in terms of violating any constraints and increasing the loss significantly.  






The targeted audience includes both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The purpose of the special issue is to provide a platform to enhance interdisciplinary research and share the most recent ideas in the above-related fields. In particular, the published article would cover, but not limited to, the following topics of energy system via designing new peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms:  


· Electricity market regulation  


· Sharing of energy storage  


· Providing demand flexibility to the grid  


· Trading of renewable energy in microgrid  


· Designing prosumer engagement plans  


· Modelling flexibility of distributed energy resources  


· Providing voltage and frequency regulation service  


· Pricing model  


· Minimizing of network loss

and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for  
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.  


This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation  
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing  
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,  
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data  
analysis, and applications.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation  
• Sensors for seamless systems: HS-GNSS, indoor GNSS, pseudolites, RTK GNSS  
with handheld devices, mitigating GNSS error when switching to indoor,  
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS  
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation  
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion

THIRD WORKSHOP ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET TRANSPORT (FIT 2021)  
[https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit](https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit)  


Dear all  


The Third Workshop on the Future of Internet Transport will be held on 21st June 2021 in conjunction IFIP Networking 2021. Please see the Call for Papers below and consider submitting your novel research papers to this workshop.  


Scope of the Workshop  
Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g.,  
transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication;  
transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi;  
transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism;  
transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments;  
SDN and cross-layer transport solutions;  
new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications;  
transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and,  
in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.  


Topics of Interest  
FIT 2021 topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
Solutions to the Internet transport layer ossification (e.g., QUIC, TAPS)

Design and performance of transport protocols in userland  
Transport protocols and solutions for multimedia traffic (e.g., WebRTC, MPRTP, RTMFP)  
Standardization of transport protocols and services (e.g., IETF TAPS)

Journal of Network and Systems Management  
Special Issue on Network management for beyond 5G systems  
============================================================================================  


Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems are expected to provide a significant increase in data rates, ultra-low latency, enhanced connectivity of a massive number of devices, and improvements in the network energy efficiency. In order to successfully implement and deploy such networks, significant novel contributions and innovations are required in the area of wireless network management.  


Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the last 5-10 years have provided a new set of algorithms and tools to solve challenging problems in multiple domains by learning complex relationships directly from data. These kinds of algorithms are also very promising to empower a new generation of fully automated network management mechanisms. However, new challenges emerge, such as deciding when to use traditional management algorithms, AI-based models, or even hybrid approaches; design AI models tailor-made for mobile management problems; decide where they have to be deployed (fog vs. edge); and how to manage their life cycle (from data harvesting to intelligent decision making).  


This special issue focuses on novel research in algorithms (especially AI-based) for network management in beyond 5G systems. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for wireless networks and system management using AI. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardisation status, and new future issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  




* Novel non-AI-based algorithms for network management in B5G systems with benchmarking against their AI-based counterparts using performance metrics such as solution optimality, algorithm complexity, resource demands, energy consumption, etc.  
* AI-based algorithms for network slicing in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for service function chaining and orchestration in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for allocation and management of resources (e.g., spectrum, storage, computing, processing) in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for network state prediction  
* Architectures and frameworks for AI-based network and system management in B5G systems  
* Strategies for designing, training, and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for wireless network management in resource-constrained environments  
* Guidelines and performance evaluation of AI-based algorithms with objectives and loss functions that are specifically designed for management in B5G systems  
* Energy-efficient techniques for data pre-processing, resource allocation, and model training and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI application to Open and Virtual Radio Access Networks.

Advances in technologies and our society will also result in an integration of our real, cyber, and virtual worlds to form smart, and cyber-physical socially aware and integrated hyper worlds. Underpinning such worlds are advanced computing (AC) infrastructure and trusted computing (TC) applications and services. For example, a robust and resilient AC infrastructure can support TC applications and services, in order to provide secure and/or privacy-preserving communications, as well as ensuring computing and communication systems and services are available, predictable, accountable, controllable, assessable, sustainable, dependable, persistent, and secure.

journal cover imageThe Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to IoMT. IoMT is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge about fifty years ago, CL has grown and developed exponentially.  


Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-based multimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a new research paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. In particular, this special issue will narrow down to focus on multimedia IoT services in real time systems and there are open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL. Moreover, this SI will explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between CL and IoMT applications including multi-model metadata generation, computational content analysis (text services, audio-visual filtering syntactic and semantic interoperability etc).  


By organizing this special issue, we aim at presenting recent and significant developments in the applications of CL with IoMT services.

Special Issue on  


DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -  


JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING  


WEBSITE:  
[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future)  


SCOPE:  
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.  


To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.  


The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.  


These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

CALL FOR PAPERS  
Elsevier Vehicular Communications (2019 IF: 4.706)  
Special Issue on  
“Revolutionary Paradigms for Smart Connected Vehicles in the 6G Era”  


[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary)  
==================================================================  


By jointly involving multiple challenging requirements, such as  
ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communications, high  
efficiency and capacity, intelligent driving is one of the most  
ambitious and attractive applications of the 6G initiatives. Although  
the convergence of communication, caching, control and computing (4C)  
resources can be leveraged to effectively enable 6G services and  
applications over vehicle-to-everything (V2X) channels, multiple  
challenges must be addressed to allow connected vehicles to meet the  
6G requirements, to securely and efficiently orchestrate their  
resources and to develop self-organizing and self-sustaining  
capabilities.  


Emerging communication paradigms that make effective data transmission  
in very high dynamic contexts include the reprogrammability of the  
environment by the means of Reprogrammable Intelligent Metasurfaces  
(RIMs). Moreover, Visible Light Communication (VLC) can improve the  
reliability of V2X interactions and be effective in terms of security  
and enhanced data rate. With focus on networking aspects, Software  
Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) can  
bring programmability, flexibility and scalability in connected  
vehicles, simplify network management and promote an efficient and  
fair use of the distributed 4C resources and programmable  
metasurfaces. They can be complemented by revolutionary networking  
models, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), to provide  
distributed caching and computing services.  


This special issue aims to collect proposals that deal with  
revolutionary communication and networking technologies for connected  
vehicles, in a holistic fashion or at different layers, to meet the  
expectations of the 6G era.  


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  


Software-defined vehicular networks  
Vehicular cloud computing in the 6G era  
Fog/edge computing architectures for connected vehicles  
Integration of SDN/NFV and vehicular cloud computing  
Information Centric Networking for Connected Vehicles  
Impact of connected vehicles on transportation safety, management,  
characterization, and prediction  
Mobile sensing networking, sensor data collection and multi-modal fusion  
Caching strategies for connected vehicles  
Joint management of communication, control, computing and caching for  
6G vehicular applications and services  
Optical wireless technologies for 6G vehicular applications and services  
Reprogrammable and Intelligent Metasurfaces for smart connected vehicles  
Secure and privacy-preserving communications in 6G vehicular networks

journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.  


Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.  


This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.

MDPI Sensors - Special Issue  


Artificial Intelligence of Things for Real-Time Data Monitoring and Processing  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/aiotd](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/aiotd)  






Call for Papers  


The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we interact with our devices at home, at work, and throughout our cities. The number of IoT devices that continuously gather data from our environment is exponentially increasing, and so is the amount of data obtained. The potential value of the data is proportional to the capacity of analyzing it and making rapid decisions. Therefore, new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are needed to intelligently let the devices learn, reason, and process the information without human interaction. In this way, the devices become smart, being able to take actions and/or make decisions in real time on their own, as humans do. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a promising paradigm that enables the use of data analytics to optimize a system and generate higher performance by making better decisions in the device itself without using the cloud. In this way, less data needs to be transferred to the cloud and decisions can be made faster. However, limited resources and IoT device capabilities pose significant challenges in supporting AI.  




This Special Issue solicits high-quality unpublished work on recent advances in real-time data monitoring and processing using lightweight AI on the IoT device itself. It welcomes theoretical contributions as well as applications in the area of AIoT. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:  




* Energy-efficient artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms;  


* Neuromorphic hardware and computing for IoT devices;  


* Edge computing-enabled AI;  


* Internet of Intelligent Things;  


* Machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making for IoT;  


* Real-time IoT data analytics;  


* Applications using AIoT.

Special Issue on Embracing Artificial Intelligence for Network and Service Management  






[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp)  






(Submissions due: 1 April 2021)  






Artificial Intelligence (AI) can harness the immense amount of operational data from clouds, to services, to social and communication networks. In the era of big data and connected devices of all varieties, artificial intelligence has found ways to improve operations and management of information technology services, systems and networks.  






Research is therefore needed to understand and improve the potential and suitability of artificial intelligence in the context of services, systems and network management. This will provide deeper understanding and better decision making based on largely collected and available operational and service data. It will also present opportunities for improving artificial intelligence algorithms on aspects such as reliability, dependability and scalability, as well as demonstrate the benefits of these methods in management and control systems. Moreover, there is an opportunity to define novel platforms that can harness the vast operational data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to drive management decisions in networks, data centers, and clouds.  






IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of four recent TNSM special issues on Data Analytics for Management in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 this special issue will also focus on recent, emerging approaches and technical models that exploits artificial intelligence in network and service management solutions. We welcome submissions addressing the underlying challenges and opportunities, presenting novel techniques, experimental results, or theoretical approaches motivated by management problems. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges and opportunities for future research are also in the scope of the special issue. We look forward to your submissions!

CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue on 6G Technologies and Applications - IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (Impact Factor: 7.921)  


Submission deadline: April 5th, 2021  


5G networks have made a significant step towards developing a low latency tactile access network and open new opportunities for innovative automation of network resources and operations. As we progress on the deployment of 5G, work to define what 6G networks should be is under way. First ideas were presented in the first two 6G special issues published in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (September 2019 and December 2020, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209).](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209).) This 6G series will lay down the concepts, basic functionalities, supported services and break-through technologies for 6G networks. The next generation of communications networks will resemble the nervous system making use of new spectrum to create new smart infrastructures that feature proactive, secure and adaptive paradigms that can be enabled by AI/ML. Smart 6G networks should address energy efficiency in the telecommunications’ sector and contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the goals of the European Green Deal, among others. With the increase of large autonomy of systems, the protection of the ‘nervous system’ against malicious attacks becomes also important. Moreover, the system autonomy and the large number of distributed sensor systems demand the simultaneous integration of distributed policies and new energy harvesting concepts. The move to machine-type communication demands radically separation of service processing and probably higher strict KPIs. These technologies and challenges will be considered within the context of 6G networks. This series is sponsored by the IEEE Future Networks initiative and is aimed at helping the research and industrial communities define and shape the architecture, technologies and services for 6G networks. We are soliciting original contributions that have not been published and are not currently under consideration by any other publications or conferences.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- 6G Dimensions and KPI requirements  
- Methods and technologies to harness new spectrum  
- AI/ML assisted PHY and networking  
- MU-MIMO and new antenna technologies  
- New medium access technologies  
- 6G networks and solutions including 6G-U and private networks  
- New core network entities and interfaces  
- Network assurance and service provisioning  
- AI/ML for 6G network management  
- Cloudification, big data, orchestration, multi-access edge computing and IoT  
- Cyber security and encrypted connectivity  
- Wireless Networking using the optical spectrum – LiFi, visible light communications (VLC), optical camera communication (OCC) and free-space optical (FSO) communications  
- Quantum communications  
- Terahertz communications  
- Green 6G networks, wireless harvesting technologies and energy efficiency  
- 6G satellite and UAV networks  
- 6G-enabled vertical applications and services  


Submissions should clearly identify how they relate to 6G and how they would progress beyond current 5G technologies. Submitted papers should contain state-of-the-art research or technical material presented in a tutorial or survey style. All manuscripts must adhere to the IEEE VTM guidelines at [http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtmagazine/submission.php.](http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtmagazine/submission.php.) Authors should submit a PDF version of their manuscript to (select Special Issue when submitting) [http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vtm-ieee](http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vtm-ieee)

## SIGCOM.tutorials  (2021-04-09) <span id="9dc74a521a"></span> <span style="color:#666;">[→top](#top)</span>



ACM SIGCOMM 2021  


August 23–27, 2021  


Virtual Event  


[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/)  






***CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS***  


[https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/cf-tutorials.html](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/cf-tutorials.html)  






+ Deadline for proposals – April 9, 2021  


+ Notification of acceptance – April 30, 2021  






We seek to extend the SIGCOMM experience by tutorials on selected topics given by renowned scientists and practitioners in their fields. We therefore solicit proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community. Keep in mind that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SIGCOMM 2021 will be held fully online.  






Tutorials must cover advanced topics that fit the scope of SIGCOMM and are of current interest to the SIGCOMM community. Tutorials may be lectures, interactive workshops, hands-on training, or any combination of the above. Successful tutorials educate the community members on emerging methods, concepts, and tools to expand the research capabilities of the community. Cross-disciplinary topics are also welcome. Exploring diverse ways of organizing the content, delivering the tutorial, and interacting with the audience in an online format are especially encouraged.  










***WHERE TO SUBMIT***  






Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, should not exceed three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the Tutorial Chairs by email to chenyang@fudan.edu.cn and retvari@tmit.bme.hu, with the subject “[SIGCOMM 2021] Tutorial Proposal”.  










**WHAT TO SUBMIT?***  






- A motivation for the tutorial (why this, why now, why at SIGCOMM?)  






- An outline of the tutorial content, including its tentative schedule (over a half-day or full-day)  






- The type of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on). It is highly recommended that full-day tutorials should include a hands-on component and not be limited to only lectures. Hands-on components are well-known to be more engaging and pedagogically better in teaching for full-day events.  






- References to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable) including their date, venue, topics and number of participants and the motivation for the new proposal.  






- Special requirements for the online tutorial (please note that our capabilities in fulfilling unusual requests are limited). A Zoom and a dedicated Slack channel will be provided.  






- Requirements for the attendees (e.g., must have their own laptop or other hardware, familiarity with certain technologies or topics, speed of Internet connection, artifacts to download beforehand, etc.)  






- A clear indication whether or not the tutorial artifacts (slides, video, notebooks, containers/VMs, etc.) are allowed to be posted publicly at the conference website.  










***IMPORTANT NOTES***  






- Each tutorial will be scheduled at a particular time slot on Monday and/or Friday on the week of the main SIGCOMM conference, possibly in parallel with the workshops. This is to foster interaction with the audience. Purely offline tutorials with pre-recorded video and no online delivery are not acceptable.  






- Preference in the acceptance decision process will be given to tutorial submissions that (1) provide hands-on experience to the attendees, (2) strive to exploit the opportunities provided by the online format (i.e., use Jupyter notebooks for hands-on material, offer preinstalled VMs/containers, etc.), and (3) build on open content that can be freely posted on the conference website.  






- It is recommended that there are up to three speakers for a full-day tutorial and up to two speakers for a half-day tutorial. It is a good idea to have another person available to feed the interactive questions from Slack channel to the presenters online.  






- Upon acceptance of a tutorial proposal, either the tutorial co-chair or the tutorial speakers can request a cancellation of the tutorial if there is clear evidence indicating low attendance of the tutorial by the early registration deadline.  






- Compensation to tutorial speakers will not be provided.

CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue "Cooperative Perception for Intelligent Vehicles" - Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.275)  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 15 April 2021 (extended).  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Intelli_Vechicles](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Intelli_Vechicles)  


Automated vehicles are expected to have a significant impact in the transport sector in the next decades, improving road safety and traffic efficiency, as well as reducing energy consumption and improving user comfort. Automated vehicles make use of a set of onboard sensors installed in the vehicle (e.g. camera, radar and lidar) that are responsible for perceiving the surrounding environment, and a set of actuators that control its longitudinal and lateral movements. One of the development objectives is to automatically perform driving tasks with less or even without driver intervention. Several studies have already shown that the sensors used in the perception process have limitations that might degrade the performance of automated vehicles. For example, in adverse weather conditions (such as rain, snow and fog), the cameras will not be able to adequately capture the environment, and in situations where the sensor’s field of vision is blocked (by other vehicles or buildings) none of the current sensors can detect beyond the position of the obstacle. To overcome these limitations and improve the perception capabilities of the vehicles, cooperative perception enables the wireless exchange of sensor information between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure nodes. Cooperative perception, also known as cooperative sensing or collective perception, enables vehicles and infrastructure nodes to detect objects (e.g. non-connected vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles) beyond their local sensing capabilities. Cooperative perception can be key for extended and timely detection of the surrounding environment and can also enable cooperative applications by compensating low penetration rates of connected road users, thus facilitating the future deployment of automated vehicles.  


The purpose of this Special Issue is to present and discuss major research challenges, latest developments, and recent advances on cooperative perception. This Special Issue solicits the submission of high-quality papers from academia and industry that aim to solve open technical problems or challenges in the context of cooperative perception. Original and innovative contributions on all aspects, both theoretical and experimental, are all welcome.  


Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website.  


Potential topics include, but are not limited to, the following:  
Application development and validation based on cooperative perception  
V2X communication algorithms and protocols for cooperative perception  
Communication technologies for cooperative perception  
Radio resource allocation for cooperative perception  
Congestion control for cooperative perception  
Infrastructure-assisted solutions for cooperative perception  
Security analysis and algorithms for cooperative perception  
Artificial intelligence and machine learning-based cooperative perception  
Sensor design and configuration for cooperative perception  
Sensor architectures and technologies for cooperative perception

CALL FOR PAPERS TECHNICAL SYMPOSIA  
IoT and Sensor Networks  


SCOPE AND MOTIVATION  
With the promise of revolutionizing the way we live, work and  
manufacture, it is no surprise why the Internet of Things (IoT) has  
picked up the momentum in both industry and academia. Thanks to the  
increased connectivity and the continued miniaturization of computers  
and smart devices, IoT will generate huge volumes of data that will have  
to be analyzed to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other  
insights. Moreover, in the industrial environments (Industry 4.0) as  
well in smart spaces (building, houses, etc.) and connected cars  
communications will require higher reliability, lower latency and  
scalability. Several technologies such as BLE, Zigbee, WirelessHART,  
IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH, 6TiSCH, LPWAN (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M etc.)  
RAW have been proposed to tackle these requirements. The forthcoming 5G  
networks promise not only increased data rates but also ultra-low data  
latency communication for critical IoT applications that require extreme  
reliability. 5G will enable Machine Type Communication (MTC) one of the  
most promising technologies for IoT applications which is gaining a  
tremendous interest among mobile network operators, equipment vendors,  
MTC specialist companies, and research bodies. This anticipated  
high-traffic demands, low-latency and deterministic delivery  
requirements stemming from IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M)  
communications can be met only with radical changes in terms of  
architecture and communication solutions. Recently, Fog/Edge-to-thing  
continuum is proposed to mitigate the heavy burden on the network due to  
the centralized processing and storing of the massive IoT data.  
Fog/Edge-enabled IoT architectures ensure closer processing in proximity  
to the things, which results in small, deterministic latency that  
enables real-time applications and enforced security.  
The IoT and Sensor Networks Symposium at IEEE Globecom 2021 aims  
at a forum that brings together scientists and researchers to present  
their cutting-edge innovations in all aspects of the field. This track  
solicits technical papers describing original, previously unpublished

IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking  


Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments  


[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments)  


CALL FOR PAPERS  


***************  


Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.  


A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.  


Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

**** Aims and Scope ****  


It is undeniable that the cities' urbanisation has modernised people's  
lives, bringing several benefits to the population. However, it has also  
brought serious challenges such as public management of collective  
spaces, air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and  
quality of life. In this context, Urban Computing emerges as a process  
of acquisition, integration, and analysis of a large volume of  
heterogeneous data generated from different sources in urban spaces,  
such as portable devices, sensors, vehicles, humans, among others. Urban  
Computing is an interdisciplinary area that connects information and  
communication technology, advanced management of large volumes of data,  
and diverse data analysis methods to propose solutions to problems faced  
by cities. In addition, Urban Computing seeks to understand the nature  
of urban and social phenomena to better plan the future of cities and  
improve their inhabitants' quality of life.  


UrbCom aims to create a space for: (1) presentation and discussion of  
studies in the area of Urban Computing; (2) collaboration between  
researchers from different areas that, given the interdisciplinary  
nature, is not limited to Computer Science.

Special Issue on:  
New Trends in High Performance Computing: Software Systems and  
Applications  
Software: Practice and Experience (Wiley Press)  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf)  


Submission due: May 31, 2021  


High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to  
continuously support  
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and  
business domains such  
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and  
financial  
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A  
number of  
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in  
the time  
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are  
developing  
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,  
and methods that  
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.  


Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate  
predictive  
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum  
advances in  
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific  
community. New  
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have  
also been  
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many  
problems that  
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and  
engineering. Training  
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing  
intensive task that  
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era  
will be the  
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep  
learning based  
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart  
manufacturing,  
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.  


While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,  
renovation in  
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance  
delivery. The exascale  
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI  
continue to  
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based  
system,  
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching

As Guest Editors, we cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue "Cloud-Based IoT Applications for Smart Cities" to be published in the journal Smart Cities (ISSN 2624-6511) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities/).  


The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement.  
Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy.  
The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT.

Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments  






[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments)  






CALL FOR PAPERS  






***************  






Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.  






A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.  






Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

CALL FOR PAPERS  


Special Issue on "Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods"  


MDPI IoT Journal  






Dear Colleagues,  


The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).  


Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.  


For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:  
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC  
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)  
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)  
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)  


Special Issue Website: [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI)  


This special issue is now open for submission, until 30 June 2021.

CALL FOR PAPERS Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Special Issue on “AI Drives Our Future Life”  


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  






SUMMARY  




While “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) becomes the mainstream of application techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented. AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications, self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI, such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both academic and industrial communities. Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g., cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).  






Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation, realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the performance and energy efficiency for various computation and memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI for  


various domains to share new findings among the community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.

######################################################################  






The Internet, and more generally networks, are today almost mandatory in each application context. They are one of the most important key enablers for applications to be considered as smart, like those used in smart agriculture or smart industry. Since the number of users and connected devices in networks keep growing, more computational and consequently more energy resources are required. This has a big impact on the environment, specifically in pollution driven by electronical components and by the carbon footprint. Over many decades, researchers have started to tackle that problem and to propose sustainable solutions like recycling and exploiting renewable energies. Still, challenges are growing as technologies, infrastructures, architectures, and applications are always evolving, requiring more and more energy. It is worth noticing that the issue is not only a matter of reducing energy consumption but also of more efficiently managing available resources and specifically energy. The smart grid, with new services like storage, can be a key enabler to efficiently manage the energy demand for networks.  


This Special Issue calls for original proposals from academia and industry on improving energy efficiency in networks targeting, but not limited to, algorithms, protocols, and architectures.

Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been  
proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at  
enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing,  
especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness),  
but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for  
example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations,  
strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move  
among different coverage areas  
in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce).  
Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in  
relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise  
also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols  
suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing  
a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches  
or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of  
theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years,  
especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original  
quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile  
networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm  
intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.

Introduction  
------------  
Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.  


As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.
