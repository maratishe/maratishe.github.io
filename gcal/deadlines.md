management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust  
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for  
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation  
• Sensors for seamless systems: HS-GNSS, indoor GNSS, pseudolites, RTK GNSS  
with handheld devices, mitigating GNSS error when switching to indoor,  
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS  
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation  
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion  
• Sensing for location-based services and applications

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues,  


GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.  
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.  
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.  
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.  
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.  
Keywords  


GNSS  
Urban applications  
Multipath, NLOS  
Hybridization, multisensor fusion  
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)  
Performance analysis and enhancement  
Integrity concepts  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 28 February 2022.  
Ctrl Publication: Immediate online publication once the paper is accepted.

The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021)  
IEEE-CS TCI  


23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy  


[http://www.ficloud.org/2021/](http://www.ficloud.org/2021/)  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.  


The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.  


IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.  


The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.

THIRD WORKSHOP ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET TRANSPORT (FIT 2021)  
[https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit](https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit)  


Dear all  


The Third Workshop on the Future of Internet Transport will be held on 21st June 2021 in conjunction IFIP Networking 2021. Please see the Call for Papers below and consider submitting your novel research papers to this workshop.  


Scope of the Workshop  
Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g.,  
transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication;  
transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi;  
transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism;  
transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments;  
SDN and cross-layer transport solutions;  
new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications;  
transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and,  
in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.  


Topics of Interest  
FIT 2021 topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
Solutions to the Internet transport layer ossification (e.g., QUIC, TAPS)  
Scalable, deployable, extensible and flexible transport protocol and service solutions for future networks (e.g., in 5G, Wi-Fi6, vehicular networks)  
New transport protocols, services and requirements (including extensions to, or evaluations of, e.g., QUIC, SCTP, RTMFP, MPTCP)  
Middlebox traversal techniques and signalling (e.g., ICE, STUN, TURN, UDP encapsulation)  
Service oriented and expressive transport APIs and Berkeley socket API extensions  
Multipath transports and intelligent multipath resource utilization and scheduling  
Transport protocols for data-center networks with implications on the Internet (e.g., DCTCP)  
Transport protocol interactions with the network, e.g., to better interoperate with Wi-Fi, cellular or satellite networks  
TCP/UDP/IP extensions for richer transport services  
Opportunistic use of QoS mechanisms (e.g., DSCP usage in WebRTC)  
Less-than-best-effort transport protocols and services  
Transport selection mechanisms (e.g., happy-eyeballing)  
Transport layer security (e.g., TLS 1.3)  
Web-based transport services (e.g., HTTP/2 and HTTP/3)  
Novel congestion control schemes (e.g. coupled, delay-based, ECN based, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT based (e.g., BBR), model based)  
Design and performance of transport protocols in userland  
Transport protocols and solutions for multimedia traffic (e.g., WebRTC, MPRTP, RTMFP)  
Standardization of transport protocols and services (e.g., IETF TAPS)  
Transport protocols performance in the virtualized and containerized environment  
Performance of transport protocols in cloud/edge environments and with latency sensitive and bandwidth-hungry applications (e.g. AR/VR in automotive).  
Novel Internet transport architectures  


Paper format and submission instructions  
Submitted papers should be unpublished work and they should not be under review by any other conference or journal. They must be no more than 6 pages (IEEE two-column format, 10pt) in total including references and figures. Papers will be reviewed single-blind. Accepted papers will appear in the symposium proceedings published by IFIP and submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

## IEEE.ACM.IWQoS.qos  (2021-02-15) <span id="31654f5f37"></span> <span style="color:#666;">[→top](#top)</span>

IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS 2021)  
25-28 June 2021, Tokyo, Japan  
[https://iwqos2021.ieee-iwqos.org/](https://iwqos2021.ieee-iwqos.org/)  


Quality of Service (QoS) has long been the focus of communications and  
networking researchers worldwide. While traditional QoS research areas  
continue attracting much interest, recent exploration of Internet of  
things, data centers, virtualization, cloud and fog computing, green  
computing, and AI has motivated a new wave of research interest in  
service guarantees with QoS, and its related metrics of Quality of  
Experience (QoE), Quality of Protection (QoP), Software Quality, Data  
Quality, or, more broadly, Quality of Information Technology.  


For more than two decades, IWQoS has established itself as a highly  
reputable forum to present novel ideas on all QoS-related subjects.

CALL FOR PAPERS  
International Workshop on Big Data in Emergent Distributed Environments (BiDEDE 2021)  


In conjunction with ACM SIGMOD 2021  


June 20, 2021, online  
Submission: February 4, 2021  


Web: [http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/bidede](http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/bidede)  
*************************************************************************************  


** Aims of the Workshop **  


Today, new forms of distributed environments beyond Cloud Computing occur that offer new kinds of applications, but pose new challenges for data management. The recent efforts for serverless computing aim at simplifying the process of deploying code in the Cloud into production by hiding scaling, capacity planning and maintenance operations from the developer or operator. Other initiatives work on avoiding the communication to the Cloud by deploying and running environments for data processing near data sources in Internet-of-Things scenarios (e.g., fog and edge computing) for large-scale smart homes, companies and cities, and near the applications (e.g., Cloudlets for mobile applications and Offline First technologies for web applications).  


Research on distributed data management evolves addressing new challenges specific to these new environments. Properties of emergent distributed environments regarding capabilities of nodes, bandwidth for communication, battery lifetime of nodes, reliability of nodes and communication, and heterogeneity of configurations impact data management mechanisms and approaches, such as those for fault tolerance, replication, resource provisioning, buffer management, query processing and optimization, and transaction management. In addition, federated approaches and polystores spanning over several emergent distributed environments are also remaining research challenges based on the need for combining these different distributed environments into one distributed runtime environment for easy handling of Big Data in different models and globally optimizing data management tasks across these different environments.  


The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to address the challenges and report and exchange the research findings in Big Data in emergent distributed environments, including new approaches, techniques and applications, make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to, and significantly advance the state of the art of Big Data in emergent distributed environments.  


** Categories of Papers **  


The workshop solicits papers of different categories:  
- Research Papers propose new approaches, theories or techniques related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments including new data structures, protocols and algorithms. They should make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to the research field.  
- System Papers describe new data management tools, stream processing engines, databases and other systems, which are able to handle Big Data in emergent distributed environments.  
- Experiments and Analysis Papers focus on the experimental evaluation of existing approaches including data structures and algorithms for Big Data in emergent distributed environments and bring new insights through the analysis of these experiments. Results of Experiments and Analysis Papers can be, for example, showing benefits of well-known approaches in new settings and environments, opening new research problems by demonstrating unexpected behavior or phenomena, or comparing a set of traditional approaches in an experimental survey.  
- Application Papers report practical experiences on applications of Big Data in emergent distributed environments. Application Papers might describe how to apply technologies to specific application domains with big data demands in emergent distributed environments like social networks, web search, e-business, collaborative environments, e-learning, medical informatics, bioinformatics and geographic information system.  
- Vision Papers identify emerging new or future research issues and directions, and describe new research visions having demands for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. The new visions will potentially have great impacts on society.  
- Demo Papers deal with innovative systems and applications for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. These papers describe a showcase of the proposed system/application, but may also explain the novelty of the system's architecture. We are especially interested in demonstrations having a WOW-effect.  
The length of papers must be within 4 pages to 6 pages. Accepted papers will be presented as oral presentations.  




** Topics of Interest **  


We are interested in all issues concerning the management of data to be processed in emergent distributed environments such as the following:

Special Issue on:  
New Trends in High Performance Computing: Software Systems and  
Applications  
Software: Practice and Experience (Wiley Press)  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf)  


Submission due: May 31, 2021  


High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to  
continuously support  
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and  
business domains such  
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and  
financial  
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A  
number of  
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in  
the time  
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are  
developing  
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,  
and methods that  
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.  


Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate  
predictive  
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum  
advances in  
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific  
community. New  
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have  
also been  
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many  
problems that  
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and  
engineering. Training  
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing  
intensive task that  
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era  
will be the  
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep  
learning based  
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart  
manufacturing,  
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.  


While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,  
renovation in  
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance  
delivery. The exascale  
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI  
continue to  
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based  
system,  
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching  
towards  
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many  
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can  
seamlessly  
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute  
resources. We  
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and  
techniques, performance  
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of  
application-level  
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and  
low-level software  
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of  
exascale in many contexts.  


Topics of interests include but are not limited to:  


+ HPC for AI and AI for HPC

Dear Colleague,  


Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications (QUESTA) will be hosting a special issue on "Learning and Control in Stochastic Networks" with a submission deadline on March 1, 2021. Details below.  


Background and Scope: The theory of stochastic networks and their control is undergoing a phase of exciting collaborative growth with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, fueled by several new applications.  


On the one hand, recent years have seen a surge of interest in the application of machine learning techniques to the control of stochastic networks arising in modern communications applications like cloud computing and data centers, the goal being to design agile control mechanisms that operate under minimal informational assumptions and that adapt to changes in system characteristics over time.  


On the other hand, stochastic networks have emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm for addressing operational questions of matching demand and supply in modern platforms and marketplaces. Examples include ride-sharing platforms, labor platforms, energy markets, etc. A key value proposition of these platforms is the ability to learn from the tremendous amount of transactional data being generated to predict and mitigate supply-demand imbalances, and to recommend and make higher value matches than would otherwise be possible without centralized recommendations and/or matchmaking. Realizing this value proposition requires network control mechanisms that seamlessly assimilate information from data while being robust to strategic concerns.  


These developments have led to a growing body of literature on the control of stochastic networks with novel architectures and at the interface of these control mechanisms with machine learning and strategic behavior. The special issue invites papers addressing novel technical challenges in this domain with direct applications to practice.

Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;  
Complex systems and networks;  
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;  
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;  
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;  
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;  
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;  
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;  
Simulation of mobile network structures;  
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;  
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm) FEC  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.  


This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.  


Possible topics include but are not limited to:  


Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;  
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;  
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;  
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;  
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);  
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;  
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;  
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;  
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;  
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;  
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

Critical Infrastructures are defined as “assets, systems or part thereof which are essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.” Critical Infrastructures refer to a multitude of sectors, including energy, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare and public safety. Systems deployed within these sectors integrate both information technologies and operational technologies, being commonly reliant on legacy industrial control and cyber-physical systems. Nevertheless, novel disruptive and enabling information and communication technologies are increasingly integrated, increasing connectivity and interdependencies, thus presenting security professionals with significant challenges in maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of such infrastructures. This Special Issue invites submissions that present innovative ideas, proof of concepts, use cases, and results from a variety of topics relevant to critical infrastructure cybersecurity and resilience, including (but not limited to) the following ones:  


Security Governance  


Security policies  
Risk analysis and management

Special Issue on Network management for beyond 5G systems  
============================================================================================  


Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems are expected to provide a significant increase in data rates, ultra-low latency, enhanced connectivity of a massive number of devices, and improvements in the network energy efficiency. In order to successfully implement and deploy such networks, significant novel contributions and innovations are required in the area of wireless network management.  


Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the last 5-10 years have provided a new set of algorithms and tools to solve challenging problems in multiple domains by learning complex relationships directly from data. These kinds of algorithms are also very promising to empower a new generation of fully automated network management mechanisms. However, new challenges emerge, such as deciding when to use traditional management algorithms, AI-based models, or even hybrid approaches; design AI models tailor-made for mobile management problems; decide where they have to be deployed (fog vs. edge); and how to manage their life cycle (from data harvesting to intelligent decision making).  


This special issue focuses on novel research in algorithms (especially AI-based) for network management in beyond 5G systems. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for wireless networks and system management using AI. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardisation status, and new future issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  




* Novel non-AI-based algorithms for network management in B5G systems with benchmarking against their AI-based counterparts using performance metrics such as solution optimality, algorithm complexity, resource demands, energy consumption, etc.  
* AI-based algorithms for network slicing in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for service function chaining and orchestration in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for allocation and management of resources (e.g., spectrum, storage, computing, processing) in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for network state prediction  
* Architectures and frameworks for AI-based network and system management in B5G systems  
* Strategies for designing, training, and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for wireless network management in resource-constrained environments  
* Guidelines and performance evaluation of AI-based algorithms with objectives and loss functions that are specifically designed for management in B5G systems  
* Energy-efficient techniques for data pre-processing, resource allocation, and model training and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI application to Open and Virtual Radio Access Networks.

JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON  






Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19  




PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021  






Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:  




● Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks  


● AI/ML applied to epidemic data  


● Approaches for resource constrained testing  


● Adaptive interventions  


● Contact tracing  


● Mobile sensing for health monitoring  


● Privacy in E-health  


● Technologies to mitigate misinformation around epidemics  


● Other communications and networking approaches relevant for combatting COVID-19

“Advanced Sensors and Sensing Technologies  
for indoor positioning and navigation”  


[https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/](https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/)  




Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet  
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust  
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for  
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.  


This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation  
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing  
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,  
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data  
analysis, and applications.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation

CALL FOR PAPERS  
Elsevier Vehicular Communications (2019 IF: 4.706)  
Special Issue on  
“Revolutionary Paradigms for Smart Connected Vehicles in the 6G Era”  


[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary)  
==================================================================  


By jointly involving multiple challenging requirements, such as  
ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communications, high  
efficiency and capacity, intelligent driving is one of the most  
ambitious and attractive applications of the 6G initiatives. Although  
the convergence of communication, caching, control and computing (4C)  
resources can be leveraged to effectively enable 6G services and  
applications over vehicle-to-everything (V2X) channels, multiple  
challenges must be addressed to allow connected vehicles to meet the  
6G requirements, to securely and efficiently orchestrate their  
resources and to develop self-organizing and self-sustaining  
capabilities.  


Emerging communication paradigms that make effective data transmission  
in very high dynamic contexts include the reprogrammability of the  
environment by the means of Reprogrammable Intelligent Metasurfaces  
(RIMs). Moreover, Visible Light Communication (VLC) can improve the  
reliability of V2X interactions and be effective in terms of security  
and enhanced data rate. With focus on networking aspects, Software  
Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) can  
bring programmability, flexibility and scalability in connected  
vehicles, simplify network management and promote an efficient and  
fair use of the distributed 4C resources and programmable  
metasurfaces. They can be complemented by revolutionary networking  
models, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), to provide  
distributed caching and computing services.  


This special issue aims to collect proposals that deal with  
revolutionary communication and networking technologies for connected  
vehicles, in a holistic fashion or at different layers, to meet the  
expectations of the 6G era.  


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  


Software-defined vehicular networks  
Vehicular cloud computing in the 6G era  
Fog/edge computing architectures for connected vehicles  
Integration of SDN/NFV and vehicular cloud computing  
Information Centric Networking for Connected Vehicles  
Impact of connected vehicles on transportation safety, management,  
characterization, and prediction  
Mobile sensing networking, sensor data collection and multi-modal fusion  
Caching strategies for connected vehicles  
Joint management of communication, control, computing and caching for  
6G vehicular applications and services  
Optical wireless technologies for 6G vehicular applications and services  
Reprogrammable and Intelligent Metasurfaces for smart connected vehicles  
Secure and privacy-preserving communications in 6G vehicular networks

Special Issue on  


DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -  


JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING  


WEBSITE:  
[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future)  


SCOPE:  
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.  


To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.  


The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.  


These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  
======================  
Article Collection "Automatic Performance Management and Optimization on Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters"  
Frontiers in Big Data Journal  
[https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs](https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs)  




Introduction  
------------  
Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.  


As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.  




Topics of Interest  
------------------  
The topics of the Article Collection include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Automated resource allocation in heterogeneous clusters  
• Workload and task scheduling in heterogeneous environments  
• Performance optimization and tuning of data-parallel applications  
• Automated data management in heterogeneous and emerging storage systems  
• Automatic parameter tuning in big data processing systems  
• Automatic big data systems tuning that is robust to workload and resource uncertainty  
• Query processing, indexing, and optimization in heterogeneous clusters  
• Data stream processing in heterogeneous environments  
• Automated provisioning of heterogeneous cluster resources

Dr. Ankit Chaudhary, University of Missouri at Saint Louis, USA  


journal cover imageThe Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to IoMT. IoMT is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge about fifty years ago, CL has grown and developed exponentially.  


Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-based multimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a new research paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. In particular, this special issue will narrow down to focus on multimedia IoT services in real time systems and there are open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL. Moreover, this SI will explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between CL and IoMT applications including multi-model metadata generation, computational content analysis (text services, audio-visual filtering syntactic and semantic interoperability etc).  


By organizing this special issue, we aim at presenting recent and significant developments in the applications of CL with IoMT services.

journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.  


Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.  


This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.

Dear Colleagues,  






The 2021 International Conference on Security and Management (SAM'21) will be held in Las Vegas, USA, July 26 – 29, 2021. It is my pleasure to invite you to submit your Paper, Poster, or Session/Workshop organization proposal. Please find attached the “Call For Papers,” “Call For Sessions,” and “Call For Posters. For further information, please click on [http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam21.](http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam21.)  






In case of hesitation by some authors/speakers to travel during Year 2021 (due to Coronavirus/COVID-19), the CSCE Steering Committee has developed the following policy:  






The author would provide his/her presentation to the congress via an FTP web link (presentation video) as well as the PowerPoint slides, or  
The author presents his/her talk via Skype/Zoom/... In this case, the presentation should not go over 15 minutes (i.e., this would allow 5 additional minutes for Q&A)  




Important Dates  






February 08, 2021: Workshops/Sessions Proposals  


March 12, 2021: Submission of full papers (about 7 pages)  


April 09, 2021: Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)  


May 05, 2021: Final papers + Copyright + Registration  


July 26-29, 2021: The 2021 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing
