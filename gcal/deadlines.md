We cordially invite you to submit your papers for the 11th IEEE International Workshop on Network Technologies for Security, Administration & Protection (NETSAP 2021).  


[https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/netsap-network-technologies-for-security-administration-protection/](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/netsap-network-technologies-for-security-administration-protection/)  


This workshop aims to discuss and advance research and development of practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. The workshop focuses on development of practical systems and methodologies including measurement and analysis of real traffic and also privacy issues about network monitoring. The workshop addresses researchers from different disciplines in academia and industry, as well as practitioners, who share interests in countermeasures against cyber attacks.  


Because of recent expansion of cyber attacks, many organizations and persons have been affected their activities on Internet. DDoS attacks to governmental sites, online trading/shopping sites are typical examples that many people cannot access to their desired information. Furthermore, there are many online services which offer DDoS attacks, so that attackers easily intimidate organizations to perform DDoS attacks.  


Increase of targeted attacks and variant explosion of malwares make security systems difficult to detect such malicious activities. As the results, incidents of information leakages have silently and frequently occurred in many organizations.  


In order to take countermeasures against the attacks, various types of systems have been proposed in literature. Although benchmark results and simulation experiments could show their good performance, most of the method could not be practically applicable to the real environment. Basically, this gap between in theory and practice is caused by too much benchmark-optimization on algorithms or by unrealistic assumptions on simulation settings.  


In this workshop, we focus on practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. Mechanisms, algorithms and strategies that are used in the real field will be discussed. Measurement and analysis of real traffic is also welcomed for aiming at new direction of the future research. In addition to the practical systems, we would like discuss on privacy issues about network monitoring.  


Any submission whose content is relevant to the area of network technologies for security, administration and protection will be considered, but any submission whose subject matter is related to one of the following topics will be particularly welcome:  


• Intrusion Detection and Protection  
• DoS Attack Detection and Protection  
• Malware Analysis  
• IP Traceback  
• Digital Forensics  
• Countermeasures against Advanced Persistent Threats  
• Network Analytics for Security

Semantic Addressing and Routing for Future Networks (SARNET21) Workshop collocated with the IEEE HPSR2021 conference  


[https://hpsr2021.ieee-hpsr.org/authors/call-for-worksop-papers/](https://hpsr2021.ieee-hpsr.org/authors/call-for-worksop-papers/)  


Workshop is focusing on research works, technical achievements, innovations and visionary papers in routing technologies and addressing in future networks (in particular Network 2030 and 5G / 6G Networks).  


The best technical, innovative, and visionary papers presented at the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the IEEE Communications Magazine Series on Network Softwarization and Management (Impact Factor: 11.052)  


Important dates: Deadline for workshop paper submission: April 25, 2021; Acceptance/rejection notification: May 5, 2021; Final workshop papers due: May 16, 2021.  


Papers submission at [https://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=28060&track=106200](https://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=28060&track=106200)  


*********************************************************************  


Workshop Scope and Context:  


The recent ongoing wider digital industrial transformation is being supported by various emerging networks technologies, with requirements for those emerging technologies, in turn, being driven from this transformation. While routing and addressing has faced many challenges in developing today’s Internet solutions, most notably scalability, there are several challenges that have emerged in recent years due to those new scenarios and deployments of Internet technology.  


The support for highly dynamic topologies is one such challenge, with satellite and vehicular networks being examples of network deployments where the larger dynamics of network nodes moving in relation to each other may cause stability challenges for existing routing protocols.  


Supporting other addressing semantics beyond network locations is another area of investigation for future routing architectures. For instance, directly addressing services or even information at the level of routable packets may improve flow completion latency while possibly posing challenges for routing scalability.  


Efficiency is another challenge that motivates some changes to addressing semantics and routing, such as integrating service and network-specific metrics into selecting the appropriate service instances, particularly in the environment with high virtualization of service functionality. The goal here is often to improve the Quality of Experience beyond merely assuring latency-bound communication. Flow-based models in addressing and forwarding, on the other hand, are used to realize the often tight latency constraints in, e.g., industrial control scenarios.  


An efficiency challenge of a different kind is accommodating short addresses, e.g., used in wireless sensing, while still preserving more comprehensive Internet connectivity. The inflexible address structure of the Internet makes header compression and translation gateways necessary, posing challenges independently.  


The challenges mentioned above are being addressed both in the presence of and as a replacement to the current Internet address and routing, which poses challenges on compatibility, restriction of semantics due to retrofitting into IPv6 semantics, and deployment of solutions.  


For this workshop, we solicit contributions that address some of the challenges we have identified, provide pathways into addressing them in the context of the existing Internet and evaluate the efficacy of the solutions. Contributions should foster discussion among participants on possible ways forward in the improvements to the Internet as we know it, provide credible solutions to drive that discussion, and evidence in the form of original designs and evaluations.  


Research works, technical achievements, innovations and visionary papers on the following topics, but not limited to, are welcome for submission to the “Semantic Addressing and Routing for Future Networks (SARNET21)” workshop:  


* Innovations in routing technologies and addressing in future networks  
* IP addressing with multi-semantics (e.g. location, name, topology, etc.)  
* Network interoperability in the presence of alternative addressing  
* Pluginized routing protocols  
* Distributed routing aggregation  
* Service routing  
* Network slice-based routing  
* Topology based routing  
* Routing security and privacy  
* Resource allocation mechanisms for deterministic data transmission  
* Protocols and methods for delivery of high precision services with KPIs guarantees  
* Methods and frameworks enabling customized functions on data packets and processes to program the header of the packets  
* High-performance in-network processing and management for routing and forwarding  
* Ad-hoc multicast creation and management  


The best technical, innovative, and visionary papers presented at the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following magazine:  


* IEEE Communications Magazine Series on Network Softwarization and Management (Impact Factor: 11.052)

Website: [https://itc33.org](https://itc33.org)  


Manuscript submission extended to ** Friday April 30, 2021 (firm) **  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  


The International Teletraffic Congress ITC 33, is the 33th edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking  
science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks  
in a holistic way. Since then, it has established a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and discussing the  
latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.  


ITC 33 focuses on the future networks taking advantage of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), towards “AI-integrated Networks”.  
Indeed, service providers from all over the world are already reaping the benefits of integrating AI into their networks. For ITC 33,  
cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering  
and control with application also to emerging softwarized/virtualized network paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenarios brought  
about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. We especially encourage original contributions which bridge the gap between  
performance modeling and real-life operational aspects, including works which leverage measurement data to provide a better  
understanding of the wired and wireless networks operation under realistic conditions.  


ITC 33 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and  
performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. ITC 33 is structured into eight different areas. The  
objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and green IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE,  
and resilience. The technical sessions will be structured around, but are not limited to, the following topics:  


• Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization  
• Network Measurements and Big Data  
• Networking Architectures and Paradigms  
• Wireless and Cellular Networks  
• Data Center Networking for Cloud Computing Design and Operation  
• Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization  
• Networking for Edge and Fog Computing  
• Network Economics  


The conference will feature a best paper award and a best student paper award. Papers receiving best paper awards of the  
conference will be invited for fast-track reviews by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering.  


Besides the general submissions, ITC33 encourages submissions for the *Ph.D. workshop* and special sessions.  


Important dates:  


**Friday April 30, 2021: Paper submission deadline (firm)**  
Monday June 14, 2021: Expected notification date  
Monday July 5, 2021: Camera-ready deadline  
Tuesday August 31 - Friday September 3, 2021: Conference dates  


For detailed information and deadlines, please check the website.  


**NOTE: ITC 33 2021 will go virtual.** The 33 Edition of International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) is taking place at the end of  
Summer 2021, and it is impossible to predict the situation in terms of the pandemic. Under the current circumstances of the  
COVID-19 pandemic, global traveling and meeting have been heavily restricted and difficult. Hence, ITC 33 will resort to  
virtual conference attendance.

Dear Colleagues,  
As one of the Guest Editors, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in the Special Issue on "Innovating the Network for Data-Intensive Science (INDIS 2020)" to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586). The manuscript submission deadline has been extended to April 30, 2021 11:59 PM AoE (final extension). For submission details, please see below or refer to our website: [https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/cfp-journal/.](https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/cfp-journal/.)  


Kind regards,

on behalf of the INDIS 2020 Guest Editors  


================================  
Scope, Aims, and Topics  
================================  
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.  


Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.  


The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.  


For this special issue to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586) related to the INDIS workshop, we encourage research papers that address one or more of the following network research challenges; and developments that are essential in the information systems infrastructure for the scientific discovery process. Participants to the workshop are invited to submit extended versions of their accepted papers. We also welcome new paper submissions on related topics.  


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  
- Data-intensive distributed application architectures  
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in service of data science applications  
- High-performance data transfer applications and techniques  
- Science DMZs and other campus network architecture constructs  
- Requirements and issues for network quality of service (QoS) or experience (QoE)  
- Multi-domain networking, including hybrid clouds, multi-domain authorization, data sharing, and data privacy  
- Network monitoring and traffic analytics, autonomous network control  
- Network management: diagnostics, troubleshooting, fault management, performance monitoring, configuration management, and scheduling  
- High-performance network protocols and network architectures  
- Securing high-speed networks

## (J)MDPI.VANET.vehicular  (2021-05-01) <span id="ff4c370a67"></span> <span style="color:#666;">[→top](#top)</span>



Dear Colleagues,  
As Guest Editor, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue "Security Measures in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks" to be published in the journal Electronics (IF 2.412) (ISSN 2079-9292) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/).  


The Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is a self-organised ad-hoc network that can be formed by connecting vehicles with other vehicles on the road and with static infrastructure such as crossroads or parking lots. VANET allows its users to share their information and knowledge about road conditions, events, and traffic. Analysing data from this type of network allows road safety to be increased efficiently by controlling crises on the road and supports traffic management thanks to Internet access for drivers and software developers.  
However, just like any network, VANET is exposed to attacks and attempts to gain access to data that are generated and transferred between network elements.  
Therefore, it has become necessary to design, develop, and extend the appropriate security methods, mechanisms and tools for VANET to protect and secure data exchanged between the network nodes, and, consequently, to secure its users and protect them against incorrect information, misinformation, and delays in information sending.  
This Special Issue aims to present a collection of papers that address problems in the methods, mechanisms, and tools for securing the VANETs and their users by exploring aspects such as security design, architectures, deployment, routing, and protocols.

Submissions Guidelines and PROCEEDINGSManuscripts should be prepared  
in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column conference  
format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted  
electronically on EasyChair at  
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiccsa2021.](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiccsa2021.) A regular paper  
must not exceed 8 pages (including all figures, tables and  
references). Submitted papers must present original unpublished  
research that is not currently under review for any other conference  
or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected  
without review. In addition, submissions received after the due date,  
exceeding the length limit, or not appropriately structured will be  
rejected without review. Authors may contact the Program Chair for  
further information or clarification.All submissions will be blind  
peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted papers will appear  
in the Conference Proceedings, and be published by the IEEE Computer  
Society Conference Publishing Services and be submitted to IEEE Xplore  
for inclusion.Each paper should include up to 7 keywords, complete  
postal and e-mail addresses, and fax and phone numbers of the  
corresponding author. Authors of accepted papers are expected to  
present their work at the conference. Submitted papers that are deemed  
of good quality but could not be accepted as regular papers, may be  
accepted as short papers.  


Double-Blind Peer Review GuidelinesAICCSA 2021 uses double-blind  
review, which means that the author’s identities are concealed from  
the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process. To  
facilitate this, authors must ensure that their manuscripts be  
prepared in a way that does not give away their identities or  
affiliations. If a submission is not anonymized, it will be rejected  
without review.  


Information to help prepare the Blinded ManuscriptBesides the obvious  
need to remove names and affiliations under the title within the  
manuscript, there are other steps that need to be taken to ensure the  
manuscript is correctly prepared for double-blind peer review. To  
assist with this process, the key items that need to be observed are  
as follows:  


• Use the third person to refer to the work the authors have  
previously undertaken, e.g., replace any phrases like “as we have  
shown before” with “… has been shown before [Anonymous, 2007]”.  
• Make sure that figures not contain any affiliation-related  
identifier.• Do not eliminate essential self-references or other  
references but limit self-references only to papers that are relevant  
for those reviewing the submitted paper.  
• Cite papers published by the authors in the text as follows:  
‘[Anonymous, 2007]’.  
• For blinding on the reference list: ‘[Anonymous 2007] Details  
omitted for double-blind review  
• Remove references to funding sources.• Do not include acknowledgments.  
• Remove any identifying information, including author names, from  
file names, etc. and anonymizedocument properties.  


Special IssuesSelected papers from the conference will be invited to  
submit an extended version to a journal to be announced. Papers will  
be selected based on their reviewers’ scores and appropriateness to  
the Journal’s theme. All extended versions will undergo reviews and  
must represent original unpublished research work. Further details  
will be made available at a later stage.

Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments  


[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments)  


CALL FOR PAPERS  


***************  


Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.  


A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.  
Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

**Scope**  


The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent scientific advances of middleware systems with a focus on the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed systems, platforms, and architectures for computing, storage, and communication. The conference will include a high quality single-track technical program, invited speakers, an industrial track, panel discussions involving academic and industry leaders, poster and demonstration presentations, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.  






**Topics of Interest**  


Original submissions of research papers on a diverse range of topics are sought, particularly those identifying new research directions. The topics of the interest for the conference include, but are not limited to:·  






Cloud and data centers  
Virtualization, auto-scaling, provisioning, and scheduling  
Data-intensive computing (big data) and data analytics  
Stream Processing  
Middleware Systems for Machine learning  
Mobile and pervasive systems and services  
Middleware techniques for Internet-of-Things, smart cities

Reviews of middleware paradigms, e.g., object models, aspect orientation, etc.  
Methodologies and tools for middleware systems design, implementation, verification, and evaluation  




Original papers of three types are sought:  






Research Papers: These papers report original research on the above topics, and will be evaluated on the significance of the problem, the novelty of the solution, advancement beyond prior work, sufficient supporting evidence, and clarity of the presentation.  
Experimentation and Deployment Papers: These papers describe complete systems, platforms, and/or comprehensive experimental evaluations of alternative designs and solutions to well-known problems. The emphasis during the evaluation of these papers will be less on the novelty and more on the demonstrated usefulness and potential impact of the contributions, the extensive experimentation involved, and the quality and weight of the lessons learned.  
Big Ideas Papers: These are papers that have the potential for opening up new research directions. For such papers, the potential to motivate new research is more important than full experimental evaluation, though some preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the approach or idea is important.  




**Submission Guidelines**

Paper Submission: May 15, 2021  
Acceptance Notification: June 7, 2021  
Camera Ready: June 14, 2021  






**** Aims and Scope ****  


It is undeniable that the cities' urbanisation has modernised people's  
lives, bringing several benefits to the population. However, it has also  
brought serious challenges such as public management of collective  
spaces, air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and  
quality of life. In this context, Urban Computing emerges as a process  
of acquisition, integration, and analysis of a large volume of  
heterogeneous data generated from different sources in urban spaces,  
such as portable devices, sensors, vehicles, humans, among others. Urban  
Computing is an interdisciplinary area that connects information and  
communication technology, advanced management of large volumes of data,  
and diverse data analysis methods to propose solutions to problems faced  
by cities. In addition, Urban Computing seeks to understand the nature  
of urban and social phenomena to better plan the future of cities and  
improve their inhabitants' quality of life.  


UrbCom aims to create a space for: (1) presentation and discussion of  
studies in the area of Urban Computing; (2) collaboration between  
researchers from different areas that, given the interdisciplinary  
nature, is not limited to Computer Science.  




**** Topics of interest (not limited to) ****  


Architectures and Protocols for Urban Environments  
Data Analysis and Mining  
D2D and 5G Communication in Urban Environments  
Data Offloading  
e-Governance  
e-Health and m-Health

DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -  


JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

IMPOTRANT DATES:  


Submission deadline: 31-May-2021  
Acceptance deadline: 31-Oct-2021  
Publication: late 2021  


SCOPE:  
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.  


To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.  


The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.  


These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.  




TOPICS OF INTEREST  
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


· Distributed Intelligence at the Edge  
· Modeling and Development of IoT applications using Edge AI  
· Distributed AI with/for Secure Edge Networking

All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.  


These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

Special Issue on:  
New Trends in High Performance Computing: Software Systems and  
Applications  
Software: Practice and Experience (Wiley Press)  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf)  


Submission due: May 31, 2021  


High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to  
continuously support  
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and  
business domains such  
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and  
financial  
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A  
number of  
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in  
the time  
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are  
developing  
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,  
and methods that  
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.  


Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate  
predictive  
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum  
advances in  
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific  
community. New  
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have  
also been  
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many  
problems that  
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and  
engineering. Training  
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing  
intensive task that  
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era  
will be the  
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep  
learning based  
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart  
manufacturing,  
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.  


While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,  
renovation in  
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance  
delivery. The exascale  
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI  
continue to  
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based  
system,  
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching  
towards  
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many  
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can  
seamlessly  
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute  
resources. We  
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and  
techniques, performance  
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of  
application-level  
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and  
low-level software  
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of  
exascale in many contexts.  


Topics of interests include but are not limited to:  


+ HPC for AI and AI for HPC  
- AI/ML/DL performance optimizations at applications or system frameworks  
levels on HPC systems

Dear Colleagues,  


The vision of a Future Internet has steered many research works. Fifth-generation (5G) networks built across the globe are considered a driving force for the Future Internet. Network softwarization strategies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are set to bring more unified control and flexibility to classic network architectures. Software-defined systems have been built to enlarge the scope of the network softwarization efforts up to the Internet scale. Services computing enables the decoupling of complex workflows. The Internet of the future is a computer, where users will say what to do, and the network will do it. The computation is brought closer to the end-users’ computers in-network at the edge. We envision the future Internet to be more accessible and high-performing across the world, with new governance models and collective intelligence. Combined and made more flexible, resorting to containerization, services computing can scale to the Internet, composing dynamic workflows with minimal data transfer and low latency.  


We invite researchers to contribute to this Special Issue with their original research works or survey papers that focus on the challenges and solutions towards realizing the Future Internet.  


Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:  


Software-defined systems for wide area networks  
Mobile edge computing (MEC) for 5G and Future Internet  
Services computing for Future Internet applications  
Towards accessible Internet  
Cloud-assisted networks and Internet-scale overlay networks  
Internet measurements for self-adaptive Internet-scale networks  
Policy, management, and economic aspects of the Future Internet  
Service workflow compositions in 5G networks  
Network function virtualization (NFV) in the Future Internet and 5G  
Software-defined cyber-physical systems  
Latency-sensitive Internet service workflows  
Internet-scale network operating systems  
Energy efficiency in the Future Internet  
Peer-to-peer networks and decentralized architectures on the Internet  
QoS control and management in the Future Internet  
Future Internet support for massive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.

THEME  


Globalization, urbanization and digitalization are rapidly changing established structures and appearances of cities and regions across the world. In particular, tomorrow’s societies face new challenges in rural and remote regions, characterized by low population densities, low potential revenues, and large distances to urban clusters and to societal service. How is economic development in these regions assured? How are democratic values and governing structures guaranteed? How will governments be able to ascertain that residents and visitors of such regions will remain a part of an inclusive society? It is widely recognized that provision of reliable fixed and mobile broadband connectivity is an important part of the answer. Ubiquitous broadband connectivity has been linked to many of the United Nations' sustainable development goals.  






The fifth cellular network generation has started to be rolled out these days, starting in the cities. For over three decades, new technologies and innovations have first reached urban regions where return-on-investment has been high, after which deployments and coverage have successively moved outwards to the countryside, rurality and regions with less operational revenues. This process has consistently generated wealth and value in urban regions first, and hence increased the urban-rural gap.  






Provision of reliable, ubiquitous connectivity with sustainable performance in remote areas is a challenge that remains unconquered despite successive generations of standards and networks. Service and equipment providers who grapple with unsustainable ARPUs, and end users who are perpetually denied the fruits of advancements in communications technology. Establishing broadband connectivity in remote and low-ARPU regions requires overcoming new and different research and engineering challenges that are not as pertinent in other topographies and demographics.  






The goal of this Research Topic is to collect and publish original research articles that contribute to bridging these divides with future networks. Timing is opportune, given that work in the area of 6G is gaining traction and early emphasis to this area can bolster the chances of it getting a fair representation. We envisage this Research Topic as a collection of timely and relevant research results that advance today's knowledge and understanding in topics related to wireless broadband access for rural and remote areas and, moreover, provide credible new insights with a good potential to impact rural societies and low-ARPU regimes everywhere.  






Submissions may span various domains of research and may focus on various critical rural-network aspects, from radio architectural and access concepts and technologies, through spectrum regulatory policies and processes, to business models and new network-operational approaches. We welcome articles (original research and survey articles, but also magazine-style articles) in both technological and techno-economical domains, analyses that increase understanding for the mechanisms of the urban-rural divide, the ARPU divide, as well as new approaches, concepts and solutions that help bridging these. Industry views and contributions are particularly interesting.  






Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:  


• Channel and propagation modeling for rural and remote regions  


• Physical layer design: coding, modulation, waveform, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming  


• Medium access control frameworks for rural scenarios  


• Networking and backhauling for rural and remote areas  


• Multi-hop network elasticity  


• Physical-layer solutions for front/mid/backhaul.  


• Delay-tolerant networks, traffic models, edge caching, etc  


• Non-terrestrial network solutions  


• Quality-of-Experience in rural and remote regions  


• SDN and SON with respect to rural/remote networks and connectivity  


• Network layout planning and maintenance, status sensing/diagnosing and performance optimization  


• Incorporating context, using cognition and applying AI/ML tools  


• Energy harvesting, energy efficiency and green solutions  


• Coexistence and convergence with 5G NR and legacy systems  


• Spectrum management, standardization, policies and regulatory issues  


• Business models for beyond-5G deployments in rural and remote areas  


• Radio or traffic measurement campaigns in rural scenarios  


• Impact of novel technical solutions on OPEX and CAPEX for rural area scenarios

First International Workshop on  
Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures in the IoT Era (EAIoT’2021)  
[http://eaiot2021.connect.rs](http://eaiot2021.connect.rs)  
In conjunction with IEEE EDOC’21  
[http://ieee-edoc.org/2021/](http://ieee-edoc.org/2021/)  
Gold Coast, Australia, October 25, 2021  


CALL FOR PAPERS  
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and  
Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all  
perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and  
competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and  
non-functional practices. According to the International Data  
Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual  
growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion  
within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT  
devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the  
Internet by 2023.  


To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design  
principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures  
are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into  
these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business,  
information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these  
foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open  
forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about  
the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of  
enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the  
lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to  
integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and  
deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a  
new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only  
a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources  
inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis,  
knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better  
understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new  
ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the  
competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial  
Intelligence (AI) trend.  


Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that  
enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could  
undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these  
obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise  
architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT  
devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and  
privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational  
capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT  
in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.  






Topics of Interest  
This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both  
disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise  
architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could  
capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of  
business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT.  
Topics for discussions include, but are not limited to:  
• Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture.  
• Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0.  
• Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture.  
• Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture.  
• Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture.  
• Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture.  
• Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture  
• Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture.

CALL FOR PAPERS  


Special Issue on "Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods"  


MDPI IoT Journal  






Dear Colleagues,  


The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).  


Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.  


For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:  
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC  
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)  
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)  
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)  


Special Issue Website: [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI)  


This special issue is now open for submission, until 30 June 2021.  


Guest Editors:  
- Dr. António M.R.C. Grilo

CALL FOR PAPERS Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Special Issue on “AI Drives Our Future Life”  


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  






SUMMARY  




While “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) becomes the mainstream of application techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented. AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications, self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI, such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both academic and industrial communities. Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g., cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).  






Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation, realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the performance and energy efficiency for various computation and memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI for  


various domains to share new findings among the community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.

They are one of the most important key enablers for applications to be considered as smart, like those used in smart agriculture or smart industry. Since the number of users and connected devices in networks keep growing, more computational and consequently more energy resources are required. This has a big impact on the environment, specifically in pollution driven by electronical components and by the carbon footprint. Over many decades, researchers have started to tackle that problem and to propose sustainable solutions like recycling and exploiting renewable energies. Still, challenges are growing as technologies, infrastructures, architectures, and applications are always evolving, requiring more and more energy. It is worth noticing that the issue is not only a matter of reducing energy consumption but also of more efficiently managing available resources and specifically energy. The smart grid, with new services like storage, can be a key enabler to efficiently manage the energy demand for networks.  


This Special Issue calls for original proposals from academia and industry on improving energy efficiency in networks targeting, but not limited to, algorithms, protocols, and architectures.  


Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:  


Energy-efficient networking;  
IA energy issues in networks;  
Smart grid management/storage service for networks;  
Energy-efficient secure networks;  
6G energy issues;  
Centric-user approaches;  
Energy consumption models for physical and virtual network components;  
Autonomous vehicles and UAV energy-efficient systems;  
Energy-efficient IoT and industrial IoT networks.

CALL FOR PAPERS  


EAI SmartGov 2021 - 3rd EAI International Conference on Smart Governance for Sustainable Smart Cities, November 24-26, 2021  
Website: [https://smart-governance.eai-conferences.org/2021/](https://smart-governance.eai-conferences.org/2021/)  


Paper Submission: 1 July 2021  


Scope  


Rapid urbanization and social change drives governments to seek out new ways to deliver services and manage cities and drives innovation in processes and policies through smart cities. At the same time, emerging digital technologies offer new ways for local government to understand and monitor the dynamics of the city, respond to the state of the city, carry out administrative tasks and streamline procedures. The complexity of smart cities and settlements means that roles and responsibilities must shift to allow a greater range of stakeholders to contribute to the design and delivery of smart services. This means that smart cities need to find new ways to interact with business, thought-leaders, suppliers, residents, and visitors. Greater transparency and frequent, two-way communication are expected with the co-creation of public services allowing for greater innovation. Advances in data science allow relevant, real-time data to be transformed into useful information to understand urban behavior and infrastructure needs. This can support evidence-based decision making, automated responses and autonomously managed procedures. Realizing this potential, however, raises concerns about privacy and security issues, the resilience of critical information infrastructures, and the unintended consequences as social expectations and behaviors are shaped by algorithms.  


In this regard, it is crucial for smart cities to provide trustworthy services which are secure, privacy aware and sustainable. Our aim is to promote the development of secure and sustainable smart cities with smart governance. The SmartGov 2021 will serve as a forum for researchers from academia, government and industries, to exchange ideas, present new results, and provide future visions on these topics.

CALL FOR PAPERS  


Special Issue on "Theoretical Models and Simulations for New  
Mobile-Computing Architectures"  


MDPI - Telecom Journal  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing)

Submission deadline: February 21st, 2021 -> EXTENDED to July 31st, 2021  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been  
proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at  
enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing,  
especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness),  
but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for  
example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations,  
strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move  
among different coverage areas  
in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce).  
Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in  
relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise  
also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols  
suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing  
a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches  
or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of  
theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years,  
especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original  
quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile  
networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm  
intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to,  
the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their  
execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;  
Complex systems and networks;  
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;  
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;  
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile  
networks;  
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with  
mobile nodes;  
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;  
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;  
Simulation of mobile network structures;  
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;  
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive environment overview, improve transportation efficiency and reduce road accidents. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning, is essential for the progress of intelligent IoV. However, with the growing complexity of on-board sensors, the big raw data sets available for deep learning can give rise to concerns over data security and privacy, as well as huge communication overheads.  


Distributed machine learning among smart vehicles and edge-cloud entities based on federated deep learning (FDL) is helping to address these challenges. FDL allows a central server to cooperate with multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model. Clients upload parameters of the trained model to the central server and keep their training data locally, thus significantly reducing the communication costs and the data privacy risks. Although FDL has great potential for intelligent IoV, further research is required in some areas. For example, the trade-off optimisation between Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption in intelligent IoV, the efficient design of learning models in FDL for different intelligent IoV problems, communication efficiency for heterogeneous IoV technologies, and the security and privacy issues related to FDL under the dynamic IoV environment.  


The objective of this special issue is to assemble high-quality research papers on emerging theories, frameworks, architectures and algorithms for solving the challenging problems related to FDL- empowered intelligent IoV. It will also offer an open platform for scholars and engineers to exchange their recent novel ideas and explore the potential convergence of existing intelligent IoV systems and advanced FDL technologies.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  
======================  
Article Collection "Automatic Performance Management and Optimization on Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters"  
Frontiers in Big Data Journal  
[https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs](https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs)  




Introduction  
------------  
Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.  


As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.

CALL FOR PAPERS  
MDPI Sensors, IF: 3.275 (ISSN 1424-8220)  
Special Issue on  
Data-Driven Cybersecurity and Safety for Critical Applications and Infrastructures  
Submission deadline: October 30, 2021  


[https://www.mdpi.com/si/57327](https://www.mdpi.com/si/57327)  
==================================================================  


Modern critical systems are pervasive and quite diversified in terms of scale, whether related to factories, utility infrastructures, vehicles or even UAVs. Nevertheless, regardless of their size or scope, such systems have one thing in common: a set of special requirements in terms of security and safety, which ultimately deem their classification as “critical”. This is due to the sensitive nature of the involved control processes and applications, whose malfunction, whether accidental or resulting of malicious intervention, may pose a significant risk to human lives, assets or essential services.  


With the emergence of complex application scenarios, either new or evolved from existing ones, the distributed nature of such critical systems is quickly unfolding into a massive scale: smart grids have pushed infrastructure components such as smart meters and inverters up to the consumer’s doorstep; the creation of services for automated UAV airspace coordination, in the scope of collision avoidance frameworks; or even vehicular networks, whose emergence may help overcome many of today’s problems associated with sustainable and safe mobility, are just a few examples. Ensuring the reliable, secure and continuous operation of scenarios with such a scale will imply the adoption of data-driven approaches, capable of dealing with considerable amounts of information to support the dependable (semi)automated analysis and decision mechanisms such applications need to become unfeasible.  


This Special Issue is aimed at representing the latest advances in data-driven and security and safety for critical applications, encompassing different application scenarios such as (but not limited to):  
• Data-driven cyber-security for critical infrastructures and essential services;  
• Vehicular networks and V2X scenarios;  
• 5G-assisted security and safety mechanisms;  
• UAV airspace coordination and navigation;  
• Industrial IoT safety and security applications;  
• Resiliency, stability and fast control algorithms for grids;  
• Algorithms and techniques for data-driven anomaly detection, for safety and security;
