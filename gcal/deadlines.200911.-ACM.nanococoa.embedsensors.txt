Nanotechnology continues to revolutionize a wide variety of fields by paving the way toward sub-µm scale devices (i.e., in the order of a few hundred nanometers). Controlling materials on such a scale is expected to give rise to integrated nanodevices with simple sensing, actuation, data processing and storage, and communication capabilities, opening the horizon to a variety of ground-breaking applications. By equipping nanodevices with wireless communications capabilities, nanotechnology will facilitate the advance of multiple disruptive applications, such as in-body communication, software-defined metamaterials and metasurfaces, wireless robotic materials, and on-chip communication. Enabling the above applications will require a broad range of expertise, ranging from nanoscale hardware design, resource-constrained computing, and channel modelling to different layers of nanonetworks' protocol development, as well as the expertise along the four detected promising application domains.

The First ACM International Workshop on Nanoscale Computing, Communication, and Applications (ACM NanoCoCoA 2020) will be held in conjunction with the The 18th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2020) on November 16, 2020. The twofold mission of this workshop is to increase the visibility of nanoscale computing, communication, networking, and supported applications, as well as to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines that can foster and develop this fast developing field.

Accepted and presented workshop papers (both work-in-progress and full papers) will be included with the ACM SenSys 2020 proceedings and published in the ACM Digital Library. Extended versions of the best workshop papers will be offered a possibility of fast-track publication at MDPI Electronics' special issue "Nanonetworking Communications: Latest Advances and Prospects" (Impact factor: 2.412, ranking 125/266 (Q2) in "Engineering, Electrical & Electronic").


S U B M I S S I O N

Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be either full or work-in-progress (WiP) papers, with at most 6 and 3 single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages, respectively, and with 9-pt font size in two-column format, including figures and tables. As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the default 9-pt font. This format will be used also for the camera-ready version of the accepted papers. Papers that do not meet the size and formatting requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the workshop submission system.
