** The Symposium **

The 2021 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Distributed Simulation
and Real Time Applications (DS-RT 2021) promises to be a grand affair
and will take place in Valencia, Spain. DS-RT 2021
serves as a platform for simulationists from academia, industry and
research labs for presenting recent research results in Distributed
Simulation and Real Time Applications.

DS-RT 2021 targets the growing overlap between large distributed
simulations and real time applications, such as collaborative virtual
environments, pervasive and ubiquitous application scenarios, motor-,
controller-, sensor- and actuator systems.

The conference features prominent invited speakers as well as papers
by top researchers in the field. DS-RT 2021 will include contributed
technical papers, invited papers, and panel discussions. The
proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS press.


** Call for Papers **

DS-RT provides an international forum for the discussion and
presentation of original ideas, recent results and achievements by
researchers, research students, and systems developers on issues and
challenges related to distributed simulation and real time
applications. Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and
practical results of significance. Demonstration of new
tools/applications is very encouraged.
