Scope & Topics
The objective of this Special Issue is to gather case study experiences of the use of cloud technology during the Covid-19 pandemic, and to discuss the way in which our cloud use has evolved during this period. We are interested in understanding the fundamental role which the cloud continues to provide in our lives. Proposals for new operational models, protocols, management approaches, and resource deployments relevant for the cloud landscape will be also welcomed. It is the aim that the SI will present a snapshot of everything related to cloud at this point in time, specific to and with a focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Lessons learnt from moving business operations to the cloud
The cloud computing landscape in 2021 as a consequence of reactions to Covid-19
SaaS deployment made during Covid-19
Cloud use to support the effort of managing and overcoming Covid-19, including vaccine development
Challenges of providing the front-line service of an online connection to cloud during times of crisis
Cloud supporting the propagation of misinformation, or fake news relating to Covid-19
Regions in need, yet restricted in their use of cloud
Supporting and managing technologically marginalised groups during times of crisis
The mental impact of not being connected during times of crisis
