Special Issue Information
Dear Colleagues,

The latest advanced machine learning techniques have contributed to great developments in various areas of interest to the academic and engineering community. In terms of methodologies employed in this field, it has seen the rise of deep learning techniques and the novel methodologies such as generative adversarial networks and natural language generation (including deep learning, reinforcement learning, transfer, and extreme learning), but may also promote the development of deep learning algorithms or methods, optimization approaches, novel hardware, software, network, and communication architectures.

The purpose of the Special Issue “Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Modeling, Signal Processing, and Intelligent Circuits and Biosensors” is to provide a forum for academic researcher, engineers, and nature and social scientists, and practitioners to present new academic research and industrial development on machine learning for modeling, signal processing, and intelligent circuits and biosensors. This Special Issue will publish original research papers in the machine learning field, covering new theories, algorithms, circuits, systems, and biosensors, as well as novel implementations and applications. The Special Issue invites papers on various disciplines of biosensor techniques and applications that address but are not limited to the following topics:

Research on sensors networks for engineering applications
Software and hardware architectures for sensorial systems
Electrical and mechanical engineering, manufacturing, failure detection, energy management, smart grid management, and optimization
Robotics and automation, computer vision, and pattern recognition applications
Transportation management, environmental engineering, surveying and geospatial engineering, spatial planning, and remote sensing
Materials science and engineering
Machine/deep learning and computer-aided design, manufacturing, and diagnosis engineering
Evolutionary intelligent optimization and applications
Data analysis with machine learning at the edge, and on the move, including localization, personalization, and optimization
Biomedical circuits and systems engineering
Biomedical sensing and health outcomes
Biomedical image reconstruction and quantitative image analysis
Biosignal processing of wearable sensors, mobile sensors, EEG headcaps and headbands, ECG sensors, breathing monitors, EMG sensors, and temperature sensors

Manuscript Submission Information

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Biosensors is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 1400 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
