CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue on 6G Technologies and Applications - IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (Impact Factor: 7.921)

Submission deadline: April 5th, 2021

5G networks have made a significant step towards developing a low latency tactile access network and open new opportunities for innovative automation of network resources and operations. As we progress on the deployment of 5G, work to define what 6G networks should be is under way. First ideas were presented in the first two 6G special issues published in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (September 2019 and December 2020, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209). This 6G series will lay down the concepts, basic functionalities, supported services and break-through technologies for 6G networks. The next generation of communications networks will resemble the nervous system making use of new spectrum to create new smart infrastructures that feature proactive, secure and adaptive paradigms that can be enabled by AI/ML. Smart 6G networks should address energy efficiency in the telecommunications’ sector and contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the goals of the European Green Deal, among others. With the increase of large autonomy of systems, the protection of the ‘nervous system’ against malicious attacks becomes also important. Moreover, the system autonomy and the large number of distributed sensor systems demand the simultaneous integration of distributed policies and new energy harvesting concepts. The move to machine-type communication demands radically separation of service processing and probably higher strict KPIs. These technologies and challenges will be considered within the context of 6G networks. This series is sponsored by the IEEE Future Networks initiative and is aimed at helping the research and industrial communities define and shape the architecture, technologies and services for 6G networks. We are soliciting original contributions that have not been published and are not currently under consideration by any other publications or conferences.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- 6G Dimensions and KPI requirements
- Methods and technologies to harness new spectrum
- AI/ML assisted PHY and networking
- MU-MIMO and new antenna technologies
- New medium access technologies
- 6G networks and solutions including 6G-U and private networks
- New core network entities and interfaces
- Network assurance and service provisioning
- AI/ML for 6G network management
- Cloudification, big data, orchestration, multi-access edge computing and IoT
- Cyber security and encrypted connectivity
- Wireless Networking using the optical spectrum – LiFi, visible light communications (VLC), optical camera communication (OCC) and free-space optical (FSO) communications
- Quantum communications
- Terahertz communications
- Green 6G networks, wireless harvesting technologies and energy efficiency
- 6G satellite and UAV networks
- 6G-enabled vertical applications and services

Submissions should clearly identify how they relate to 6G and how they would progress beyond current 5G technologies. Submitted papers should contain state-of-the-art research or technical material presented in a tutorial or survey style. All manuscripts must adhere to the IEEE VTM guidelines at http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtmagazine/submission.php. Authors should submit a PDF version of their manuscript to (select Special Issue when submitting) http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vtm-ieee
