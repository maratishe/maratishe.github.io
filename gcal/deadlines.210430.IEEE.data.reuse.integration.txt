Intelligent  applications  derive  from  Information  Reuse  and  Integration  (IRI)  and  data  science.  IRI  seeks  to  maximize  the  utility  of  information  by  creating  simple  cost-effective  representations  of  knowledge.  IRI  consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications.

The  authors need to mark  if  their  submission is for the “Regular Research Track”, or for the “Industry/Applications Track”.

If web submission is not possible, please contact the program co-chair, Dr. Danda Rawat (db.rawat@ieee.org) for alternate  arrangements. Papers  will  be  selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and  clarity of presentation.
