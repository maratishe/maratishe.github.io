First International Workshop on
Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures in the IoT Era (EAIoT’2021)
http://eaiot2021.connect.rs
In conjunction with IEEE EDOC’21
http://ieee-edoc.org/2021/
Gold Coast, Australia, October 25, 2021

CALL FOR PAPERS
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all 
perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and 
competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and 
non-functional practices. According to the International Data 
Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion 
within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT 
devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the 
Internet by 2023.

  To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design 
principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures 
are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into 
these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business, 
information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these 
foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open 
forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about 
the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of 
enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the 
lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to 
integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and 
deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a 
new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only 
a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources 
inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis, 
knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better 
understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new 
ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the 
competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) trend.

Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that 
enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could 
undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these 
obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise 
architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT 
devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and 
privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational 
capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT 
in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.



Topics of Interest
This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both 
disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise 
architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could 
capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of 
business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT. 
Topics for discussions include, but are not limited to:
•       Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0.
•       Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture
•       Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Context management and awareness for IoT-based enterprise architecture
•       Case studies related to IoT-based enterprise architecture.

We cordially invite you to submit your papers for the 11th IEEE International Workshop on Network Technologies for Security, Administration & Protection (NETSAP 2021).

https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/netsap-network-technologies-for-security-administration-protection/

This workshop aims to discuss and advance research and development of practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. The workshop focuses on development of practical systems and methodologies including measurement and analysis of real traffic and also privacy issues about network monitoring. The workshop addresses researchers from different disciplines in academia and industry, as well as practitioners, who share interests in countermeasures against cyber attacks.

Because of recent expansion of cyber attacks, many organizations and persons have been affected their activities on Internet. DDoS attacks to governmental sites, online trading/shopping sites are typical examples that many people cannot access to their desired information. Furthermore, there are many online services which offer DDoS attacks, so that attackers easily intimidate organizations to perform DDoS attacks.

Increase of targeted attacks and variant explosion of malwares make security systems difficult to detect such malicious activities. As the results, incidents of information leakages have silently and frequently occurred in many organizations.

In order to take countermeasures against the attacks, various types of systems have been proposed in literature. Although benchmark results and simulation experiments could show their good performance, most of the method could not be practically applicable to the real environment. Basically, this gap between in theory and practice is caused by too much benchmark-optimization on algorithms or by unrealistic assumptions on simulation settings.

In this workshop, we focus on practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. Mechanisms, algorithms and strategies that are used in the real field will be discussed. Measurement and analysis of real traffic is also welcomed for aiming at new direction of the future research. In addition to the practical systems, we would like discuss on privacy issues about network monitoring.

Any submission whose content is relevant to the area of network technologies for security, administration and protection will be considered, but any submission whose subject matter is related to one of the following topics will be particularly welcome:

        • Intrusion Detection and Protection
        • DoS Attack Detection and Protection
        • Malware Analysis
        • IP Traceback
        • Digital Forensics
        • Countermeasures against Advanced Persistent Threats

DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS  -

JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

WEBSITE:
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future


IMPOTRANT DATES:

Submission deadline: 31-May-2021
Acceptance deadline: 31-Oct-2021
Publication: late 2021

SCOPE:
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.

To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.

The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.

These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

Dear Colleagues,

The vision of a Future Internet has steered many research works. Fifth-generation (5G) networks built across the globe are considered a driving force for the Future Internet. Network softwarization strategies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are set to bring more unified control and flexibility to classic network architectures. Software-defined systems have been built to enlarge the scope of the network softwarization efforts up to the Internet scale. Services computing enables the decoupling of complex workflows. The Internet of the future is a computer, where users will say what to do, and the network will do it. The computation is brought closer to the end-users’ computers in-network at the edge. We envision the future Internet to be more accessible and high-performing across the world, with new governance models and collective intelligence. Combined and made more flexible, resorting to containerization, services computing can scale to the Internet, composing dynamic workflows with minimal data transfer and low latency.

Special Issue on Federated Deep Learning-Empowered Internet of Vehicles

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is designed to seamlessly connect smart vehicles, road infrastructures, communication facilities and users. The goal is to provide a comprehensive environment overview, improve transportation efficiency and reduce road accidents. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning, is essential for the progress of intelligent IoV. However, with the growing complexity of on-board sensors, the big raw data sets available for deep learning can give rise to concerns over data security and privacy, as well as huge communication overheads.

Distributed machine learning among smart vehicles and edge-cloud entities based on federated deep learning (FDL) is helping to address these challenges.  FDL allows a central server to cooperate with multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model. Clients upload parameters of the trained model to the central server and keep their training data locally, thus significantly reducing the communication costs and the data privacy risks. Although FDL has great potential for intelligent IoV, further research is required in some areas. For example, the trade-off optimisation between Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption in intelligent IoV, the efficient design of learning models in FDL for different intelligent IoV problems, communication efficiency for heterogeneous IoV technologies, and the security and privacy issues related to FDL under the dynamic IoV environment.

The objective of this special issue is to assemble high-quality research papers on emerging theories, frameworks, architectures and algorithms for solving the challenging problems related to FDL- empowered intelligent IoV. It will also offer an open platform for scholars and engineers to exchange their recent novel ideas and explore the potential convergence of existing intelligent IoV systems and advanced FDL technologies.

Topics Covered:

Novel FDL algorithms for intelligent IoV systems and applications
Architectures and models for FDL-empowered IoV
Theory and protocols for FDL-empowered IoV
Resource management for FDL-empowered IoV
Communication-efficiency in FDL-empowered IoV
Big data and data analytics in FDL-empowered IoV
Traffic and network status predictions in FDL-empowered IoV
Performance optimisation for FDL-empowered IoV
Energy-efficiency in FDL-empowered IoV
Security and privacy in FDL-empowered IoV
Convergence of blockchain and FDL-empowered IoV
Use cases and real-world experiments for FDL-empowered IoV
Important Deadlines:

Submission deadline: 31 July 2021
Acceptance deadline: 30 Jan 2022
Publication date: March 2022

================================
   Scope, Aims, and Topics
================================
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.

Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.

The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.

For this special issue to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586) related to the INDIS workshop, we encourage research papers that address one or more of the following network research challenges; and developments that are essential in the information systems infrastructure for the scientific discovery process. Participants to the workshop are invited to submit extended versions of their accepted papers. We also welcome new paper submissions on related topics.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Data-intensive distributed application architectures
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in service of data science applications
- High-performance data transfer applications and techniques
- Science DMZs and other campus network architecture constructs
- Requirements and issues for network quality of service (QoS) or experience (QoE)
- Multi-domain networking, including hybrid clouds, multi-domain authorization, data sharing, and data privacy
- Network monitoring and traffic analytics, autonomous network control
- Network management: diagnostics, troubleshooting, fault management, performance monitoring, configuration management, and scheduling
- High-performance network protocols and network architectures
- Securing high-speed networks
- Cross-layer network architectures and concepts

================================
   Submission Guidelines

*********************************************************************

Workshop Scope and Context:

The recent ongoing wider digital industrial transformation is being supported by various emerging networks technologies, with requirements for those emerging technologies, in turn, being driven from this transformation. While routing and addressing has faced many challenges in developing today’s Internet solutions, most notably scalability, there are several challenges that have emerged in recent years due to those new scenarios and deployments of Internet technology.

The support for highly dynamic topologies is one such challenge, with satellite and vehicular networks being examples of network deployments where the larger dynamics of network nodes moving in relation to each other may cause stability challenges for existing routing protocols.

Supporting other addressing semantics beyond network locations is another area of investigation for future routing architectures. For instance, directly addressing services or even information at the level of routable packets may improve flow completion latency while possibly posing challenges for routing scalability.

Efficiency is another challenge that motivates some changes to addressing semantics and routing, such as integrating service and network-specific metrics into selecting the appropriate service instances, particularly in the environment with high virtualization of service functionality. The goal here is often to improve the Quality of Experience beyond merely assuring latency-bound communication. Flow-based models in addressing and forwarding, on the other hand, are used to realize the often tight latency constraints in, e.g., industrial control scenarios.

An efficiency challenge of a different kind is accommodating short addresses, e.g., used in wireless sensing, while still preserving more comprehensive Internet connectivity. The inflexible address structure of the Internet makes header compression and translation gateways necessary, posing challenges independently.

The challenges mentioned above are being addressed both in the presence of and as a replacement to the current Internet address and routing, which poses challenges on compatibility, restriction of semantics due to retrofitting into IPv6 semantics, and deployment of solutions.

For this workshop, we solicit contributions that address some of the challenges we have identified, provide pathways into addressing them in the context of the existing Internet and evaluate the efficacy of the solutions. Contributions should foster discussion among participants on possible ways forward in the improvements to the Internet as we know it, provide credible solutions to drive that discussion, and evidence in the form of original designs and evaluations.

Research works, technical achievements, innovations and visionary papers on the following topics, but not limited to, are welcome for submission to the “Semantic Addressing and Routing for Future Networks (SARNET21)” workshop:

* Innovations in routing technologies and addressing in future networks
* IP addressing with multi-semantics (e.g. location, name, topology, etc.)
* Network interoperability in the presence of alternative addressing
* Pluginized routing protocols
* Distributed routing aggregation
* Service routing
* Network slice-based routing
* Topology based routing
* Routing security and privacy
* Resource allocation mechanisms for deterministic data transmission
* Protocols and methods for delivery of high precision services with KPIs guarantees
* Methods and frameworks enabling customized functions on data packets and processes to program the header of the packets
* High-performance in-network processing and management for routing and forwarding
* Ad-hoc multicast creation and management

The best technical, innovative, and visionary papers presented at the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version for fast-track review in the following magazine:

* IEEE Communications Magazine Series on Network Softwarization and Management (Impact Factor: 11.052)

IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking

Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments

https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments

CALL FOR PAPERS 

***************

Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.

A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.

Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

CALL FOR PAPERS

EAI SmartGov 2021 - 3rd EAI International Conference on Smart Governance for Sustainable Smart Cities, November 24-26, 2021
Website: https://smart-governance.eai-conferences.org/2021/

Paper Submission: 1 July 2021

Scope

Rapid urbanization and social change drives governments to seek out new ways to deliver services and manage cities and drives innovation in processes and policies through smart cities. At the same time, emerging digital technologies offer new ways for local government to understand and monitor the dynamics of the city, respond to the state of the city, carry out administrative tasks and streamline procedures. The complexity of smart cities and settlements means that roles and responsibilities must shift to allow a greater range of stakeholders to contribute to the design and delivery of smart services. This means that smart cities need to find new ways to interact with business, thought-leaders, suppliers, residents, and visitors. Greater transparency and frequent, two-way communication are expected with the co-creation of public services allowing for greater innovation. Advances in data science allow relevant, real-time data to be transformed into useful information to understand urban behavior and infrastructure needs. This can support evidence-based decision making, automated responses and autonomously managed procedures. Realizing this potential, however, raises concerns about privacy and security issues, the resilience of critical information infrastructures, and the unintended consequences as social expectations and behaviors are shaped by algorithms.

In this regard, it is crucial for smart cities to provide trustworthy services which are secure, privacy aware and sustainable. Our aim is to promote the development of secure and sustainable smart cities with smart governance. The SmartGov 2021 will serve as a forum for researchers from academia, government and industries, to exchange ideas, present new results, and provide future visions on these topics.

Special Issue on
Data-Driven Cybersecurity and Safety for Critical Applications and Infrastructures
Submission deadline: October 30, 2021

https://www.mdpi.com/si/57327
==================================================================
 
Modern critical systems are pervasive and quite diversified in terms of scale, whether related to factories, utility infrastructures, vehicles or even UAVs. Nevertheless, regardless of their size or scope, such systems have one thing in common: a set of special requirements in terms of security and safety, which ultimately deem their classification as “critical”. This is due to the sensitive nature of the involved control processes and applications, whose malfunction, whether accidental or resulting of malicious intervention, may pose a significant risk to human lives, assets or essential services.
 
With the emergence of complex application scenarios, either new or evolved from existing ones, the distributed nature of such critical systems is quickly unfolding into a massive scale: smart grids have pushed infrastructure components such as smart meters and inverters up to the consumer’s doorstep;  the creation of services for automated UAV airspace coordination, in the scope of collision avoidance frameworks; or even vehicular networks, whose emergence may help overcome many of today’s problems associated with sustainable and safe mobility, are just a few examples. Ensuring the reliable, secure and continuous operation of scenarios with such a scale will imply the adoption of data-driven approaches, capable of dealing with considerable amounts of information to support the dependable (semi)automated analysis and decision mechanisms such applications need to become unfeasible.
 
This Special Issue is aimed at representing the latest advances in data-driven and security and safety for critical applications, encompassing different application scenarios such as (but not limited to):
• Data-driven cyber-security for critical infrastructures and essential services;
• Vehicular networks and V2X scenarios;
• 5G-assisted security and safety mechanisms;
• UAV airspace coordination and navigation;
• Industrial IoT safety and security applications;
• Resiliency, stability and fast control algorithms for grids;
• Algorithms and techniques for data-driven anomaly detection, for safety and security;
 
** Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 October 2021 **
 
Manuscript Preparation and Submission
Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website.  Authors should follow the “Manuscript Submission Information” guidelines (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/cybersecurity_safety#info).

Summary



Recent considerable advancements in the emerging yet promising paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its convergence with the state-of-the-art wireless communication technologies has led to the evolution of conventional vehicular ad hoc networks into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV is primarily an amalgamation of a variety of network entities, i.e., vehicles, vulnerable pedestrians, and supporting roadside infrastructure, and act as a dynamic communication system for facilitating real-time efficient information sharing among these entities in order to guarantee safer navigation and intelligent traffic management. This not only entails vehicle-to-vehicle communication but also takes into consideration vehicle-to-human, vehicle-to-road, and vehicle-to-sensor interactions. Hence, recently, the notion of IoV is being explored by researchers and scientists from both academia and industry, nevertheless, significant developments from a wide variety of technological facets still need to be materialized so as to unleash the true potential of IoV in the realm of intelligent transportation system which itself is integral to the evolution of futuristic smart and connected cities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The International Teletraffic Congress ITC 33, is the 33th edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking 
science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks 
in a holistic way. Since then, it has established a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and discussing the 
latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.

ITC 33 focuses on the future networks taking advantage of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), towards “AI-integrated Networks”. 
Indeed, service providers from all over the world are already reaping the benefits of integrating AI into their networks. For ITC 33, 
cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering 
and control with application also to emerging softwarized/virtualized network paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenarios brought 
about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. We especially encourage original contributions which bridge the gap between 
performance modeling and real-life operational aspects, including works which leverage measurement data to provide a better 
understanding of the wired and wireless networks operation under realistic conditions.

ITC 33 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and 
performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. ITC 33 is structured into eight different areas. The 
objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and green IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, 
and resilience. The technical sessions will be structured around, but are not limited to, the following topics:

• Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization
• Network Measurements and Big Data
• Networking Architectures and Paradigms
• Wireless and Cellular Networks
• Data Center Networking for Cloud Computing Design and Operation
• Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization
• Networking for Edge and Fog Computing 
• Network Economics 

The conference will feature a best paper award and a best student paper award. Papers receiving best paper awards of the 
conference will be invited for fast-track reviews by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering. 

Besides the general submissions, ITC33 encourages submissions for the *Ph.D. workshop* and special sessions. 

Important dates: 

**Friday April 30, 2021: Paper submission deadline (firm)**
Monday June 14, 2021: Expected notification date
Monday July 5, 2021: Camera-ready deadline
Tuesday August 31 - Friday September 3, 2021: Conference dates

For detailed information and deadlines, please check the website. 

**NOTE: ITC 33 2021 will go virtual.** The 33 Edition of International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) is taking place at the end of 
Summer 2021, and it is impossible to predict the situation in terms of the pandemic. Under the current circumstances of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, global traveling and meeting have been heavily restricted and difficult. Hence, ITC 33 will resort to 
virtual conference attendance.

THEME

Globalization, urbanization and digitalization are rapidly changing established structures and appearances of cities and regions across the world. In particular, tomorrow’s societies face new challenges in rural and remote regions, characterized by low population densities, low potential revenues, and large distances to urban clusters and to societal service. How is economic development in these regions assured? How are democratic values and governing structures guaranteed? How will governments be able to ascertain that residents and visitors of such regions will remain a part of an inclusive society? It is widely recognized that provision of reliable fixed and mobile broadband connectivity is an important part of the answer. Ubiquitous broadband connectivity has been linked to many of the United Nations' sustainable development goals.

 

The fifth cellular network generation has started to be rolled out these days, starting in the cities. For over three decades, new technologies and innovations have first reached urban regions where return-on-investment has been high, after which deployments and coverage have successively moved outwards to the countryside, rurality and regions with less operational revenues. This process has consistently generated wealth and value in urban regions first, and hence increased the urban-rural gap.

 

Provision of reliable, ubiquitous connectivity with sustainable performance in remote areas is a challenge that remains unconquered despite successive generations of standards and networks. Service and equipment providers who grapple with unsustainable ARPUs, and end users who are perpetually denied the fruits of advancements in communications technology. Establishing broadband connectivity in remote and low-ARPU regions requires overcoming new and different research and engineering challenges that are not as pertinent in other topographies and demographics.

 

The goal of this Research Topic is to collect and publish original research articles that contribute to bridging these divides with future networks. Timing is opportune, given that work in the area of 6G is gaining traction and early emphasis to this area can bolster the chances of it getting a fair representation. We envisage this Research Topic as a collection of timely and relevant research results that advance today's knowledge and understanding in topics related to wireless broadband access for rural and remote areas and, moreover, provide credible new insights with a good potential to impact rural societies and low-ARPU regimes everywhere.

 

Submissions may span various domains of research and may focus on various critical rural-network aspects, from radio architectural and access concepts and technologies, through spectrum regulatory policies and processes, to business models and new network-operational approaches. We welcome articles (original research and survey articles, but also magazine-style articles) in both technological and techno-economical domains, analyses that increase understanding for the mechanisms of the urban-rural divide, the ARPU divide, as well as new approaches, concepts and solutions that help bridging these. Industry views and contributions are particularly interesting.

 

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

• Channel and propagation modeling for rural and remote regions

• Physical layer design: coding, modulation, waveform, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming

• Medium access control frameworks for rural scenarios

• Networking and backhauling for rural and remote areas

• Multi-hop network elasticity

• Physical-layer solutions for front/mid/backhaul.

• Delay-tolerant networks, traffic models, edge caching, etc

• Non-terrestrial network solutions

• Quality-of-Experience in rural and remote regions

• SDN and SON with respect to rural/remote networks and connectivity

• Network layout planning and maintenance, status sensing/diagnosing and performance optimization

• Incorporating context, using cognition and applying AI/ML tools

• Energy harvesting, energy efficiency and green solutions

• Coexistence and convergence with 5G NR and legacy systems

• Spectrum management, standardization, policies and regulatory issues

• Business models for beyond-5G deployments in rural and remote areas

• Radio or traffic measurement campaigns in rural scenarios

• Impact of novel technical solutions on OPEX and CAPEX for rural area scenarios

 

----------------------------------------------

Frontiers ranks as the fifth most-cited publisher among the 20 largest publishers in 2020, with more than 1.6 million overall citations. The new journal of Frontiers “Frontiers in Communications and Networks” publishes cutting edge research in telecommunication across different domains. The editorial board of Frontiers and Communications and Networks consists of global leading and active researchers in the field of wireless and wired communication systems and networks.

Submissions Guidelines and PROCEEDINGSManuscripts should be prepared 
in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column conference 
format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted 
electronically on EasyChair at 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiccsa2021. A regular paper 
must not exceed 8 pages (including all figures, tables and 
references). Submitted papers must present original unpublished 
research that is not currently under review for any other conference 
or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected 
without review. In addition, submissions received after the due date, 
exceeding the length limit, or not appropriately structured will be 
rejected without review. Authors may contact the Program Chair for 
further information or clarification.All submissions will be blind 
peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted papers will appear 
in the Conference Proceedings, and be published by the IEEE Computer 
Society Conference Publishing Services and be submitted to IEEE Xplore 
for inclusion.Each paper should include up to 7 keywords, complete 
postal and e-mail addresses, and fax and phone numbers of the 
corresponding author. Authors of accepted papers are expected to 
present their work at the conference. Submitted papers that are deemed 
of good quality but could not be accepted as regular papers, may be 
accepted as short papers.

Double-Blind Peer Review GuidelinesAICCSA 2021 uses double-blind 
review, which means that the author’s identities are concealed from 
the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process. To 
facilitate this, authors must ensure that their manuscripts be 
prepared in a way that does not give away their identities or 
affiliations. If a submission is not anonymized, it will be rejected 
without review.

Information to help prepare the Blinded ManuscriptBesides the obvious 
need to remove names and affiliations under the title within the 
manuscript, there are other steps that need to be taken to ensure the 
manuscript is correctly prepared for double-blind peer review. To 
assist with this process, the key items that need to be observed are 
as follows:

• Use the third person to refer to the work the authors have 
previously undertaken, e.g., replace any phrases like “as we have 
shown before” with “… has been shown before [Anonymous, 2007]”.
• Make sure that figures not contain any affiliation-related 
identifier.• Do not eliminate essential self-references or other 
references but limit self-references only to papers that are relevant 
for those reviewing the submitted paper.
• Cite papers published by the authors in the text as follows: 
‘[Anonymous, 2007]’.
• For blinding on the reference list: ‘[Anonymous 2007] Details 
omitted for double-blind review
• Remove references to funding sources.• Do not include acknowledgments.
• Remove any identifying information, including author names, from 
file names, etc. and anonymizedocument properties.

Special IssuesSelected papers from the conference will be invited to 
submit an extended version to a journal to be announced. Papers will 
be selected based on their reviewers’ scores and appropriateness to 
the Journal’s theme. All extended versions will undergo reviews and 
must represent original unpublished research work. Further details 
will be made available at a later stage.
