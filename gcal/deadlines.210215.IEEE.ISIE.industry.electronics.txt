Special Session on
Intelligent Edge Learning for Industrial IoT
in conjunction with
IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)
Kyoto Japan, 20-23 June 2021

=====================================================
(Supported by IEEE IES Technical Committee on Cloud and Wireless Systems for Industrial Applications)

On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is our great honor to invite all delegates, representatives, and participants from all around the world to take part in the 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), held 20-23 June 2021 in Kyoto, Japan. The ISIE annually gathers industry experts, researchers, and academics to share ideas and experiences surrounding frontier technologies, breakthroughs, innovative solutions, research results, and initiatives related to industrial electronics and their applications.

In case the author cannot come to Kyoto due to this pandemic, we will offer an option for remote (online) presentations.

Further information will be updated on this website at a later date.

The main theme of ISIE2021 is SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Especially “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, and “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”.

Moreover, the year “2021” is the 70th anniversary of IES. ISIE2021 will have “the commemorative event of 70th anniversary of IES”. Please enjoy and contribute to the 70th-anniversary events in ISIE2021!


Scope of the Session:
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!
ssion is to provide a forum for sci
entists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-progress on all aspects of intelligent edge learning for industrial IoT.


Topics of interest:
o Edge, fog, and mobile edge computing for Industrial IoT
o Machine learning and computational intelligence for handling big data in Industrial applications
o Information-centric networking and software-defined network for edge intelligence
o Intelligent edge-based mobile computing and analysis
o Multimedia QoS, and traffic management in industrial networks
o Real-time communication interfaces and protocols
o Intelligent infrastructures at the edge
o Hardware testbed or field trial for AI-driven intelligent edge computing for industrial applications
o Security and related considerations in intelligent edge computing
o Intelligent routing and load balancing for edge computing
o Multiple access technologies for edge computing
o Network protocols for distributed machine learning
