====================================================

** Due to the COVID-19 situation, PDAA 2020 will be held virtually this year.

[Bridging Theory and Practice in Parallel and Distributed Computing]

The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for the exchange and dissemination of new ideas, techniques and research in the field of parallel and distributed algorithms and
applications. The workshop is meant to bridge research of theory and practice in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. We are convinced that the workshop atmosphere will be conducive to
open and mutually beneficial exchanges of ideas between the participants of these areas.
