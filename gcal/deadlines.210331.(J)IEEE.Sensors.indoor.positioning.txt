CALL FOR PAPERS

IEEE Sensors Journal Special Issue on

“Advanced Sensors and Sensing Technologies
for indoor positioning and navigation”

https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/


Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust
and seamless positioning  technologies. While mature GNSS  solutions exist for
outdoor spaces,  more than ten  years of  research and development  of sensing
technologies  have not  yet led  to a  widely available  offer of  generic and
affordable standard  solutions for indoors.  Nonetheless, year after  year the
insight that  researchers have  offered into  indoor localization  provides us
with more  methods and the array  of usable sensors widens  with technological
progress. Hybridization of sensors data,  smart capture of environmental data,
benchmarking of sensing  and positioning technologies are all at  the heart of
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.

This Special Issue of the IEEE  Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation
of innovations and  improvements in the field of advanced  sensors and sensing
technologies for  indoor positioning and navigation  including theory, design,
modelling,  configuration,  characterization,  sensor  data  processing,  data
analysis, and applications.

Original  research  contributions  and  review  papers  are  sought  in  areas
including:

• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:
AoA, TOF,  TDOA based localisation,  RSSI and magnetic  fingerprinting, PDR,
IMU  and hybrid  systems,  UWB, ultrasound,  optical  systems, RFID,  radar,
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation
• Sensors for  seamless systems: HS-GNSS,  indoor GNSS, pseudolites,  RTK GNSS
with  handheld devices,  mitigating  GNSS error  when  switching to  indoor,
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion
• Sensing for location-based services and applications
• Sensors benchmarking, assessment, evaluation, standards
