SCOPE AND TOPICS
----------------------
During the last decade, 5G technology has been developed and successfully commercialized for mobile communication networks. 5G technology supports enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication, massive machine type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT), devices and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical devices with IMT-2020 standard aims.

Some key technologies, such as 5G numerology with new radio (NR) waveform in sub- or above 6 GHz (mmWave) bands and MIMO with beamforming, allow those heterogeneous devices or services to overcome their own challenging scenarios. Still, 5G access technology has further challenges, as it is now evolving with convergence technologies, such as autonomously driven vehicles, smart factories, satellite or UAS, public safety, etc. This 5G+ demands more bandwidth, connectivity, and reliability.   

Wireless communications in the Terahertz (THz) frequency band and unlicensed bands such as private 5G are considered to provide ultra-high user data rates. Further, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been explored for spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. V2X communication using mmWave side-links is not under-standardized. 5G and 6G now consider interoperation of GEO or LEO satellites and UAS to control autonomous vehicles, including drones, and provide wide-area cells for public safety or content broadcast. This nationwide cell can improve reliability and service continuity. As 5G+ pursues more than low-latency end-to-end access delay (<1 ms), mobile edge computing (MEC) has received attention in terms of supporting the requirements of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) to improve performance. 

This Special Issue will present the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 5G access communication and its evolution. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit their original manuscripts.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Sub- or above 6 GHz radio access technologies for 5G+       
- V2X communication using mmWave links     
- NOMA for 5G and beyond wireless networks     
- THz communications for 5G+ eMBB   
- Fog and MEC architecture for 5G access networks     
- Machine learning aided Fog and MEC operation   
- (Massive) multiple-inputâ€“multiple-output (MIMO) for a 5G+ access network   
- Network function virtualization (NFV) and hardware acceleration for data plane processing of 5G access traffic
- Traffic measurements and analysis (control and data plane) of 5G access networks
- SDN-assisted control plane in 5G access networks     
- Multi-connectivity and co-existence in satellite/UAS and a 5G network   
- Private 5G access network by dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
- Localization issue in indoor or city canyon


MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION INFORMATION
----------------------
Manuscripts should be submitted at www.mdpi.com by registering at https://susy.mdpi.com and logging in to the website. Once you are registered, click https://bit.ly/5G-access to go to the submission form. Select "Submit Manuscript", choose the journal "Electronics", the section "Networks" and the special issue "Access Technology in 5G and Mobile Communication Networks". Manuscripts can be submitted now until the deadline. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/instructions. Electronics is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 1500 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
