KSEM 2021 is the Fourthteen in this series, which builds on the success of twelve previous events of the International Conference on Knowledge Science. The aim of this interdisciplinary conference is to provide a forum for researchers in the broad areas of knowledge science, knowledge engineering, and knowledge management to exchange ideas and to report state of the art research results. KSEM is in the list of CCF (China Computer Federation) recommended Conferences (C series, Artificial Intelligence)

=============================
