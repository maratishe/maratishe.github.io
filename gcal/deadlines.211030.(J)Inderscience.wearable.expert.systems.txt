Wearable devices are electronic devices worn by consumers ubiquitously and continually to capture or track biometric information related to health or fitness. Wearable devices range from smartwatches and fitness trackers to virtual reality (VR) headsets, physiological and real-time health monitoring, navigation systems, advanced textiles, military personnel wear and so on.

Research into wearable devices a hot area, specifically for researchers working in personal and ubiquitous computing. Several challenges with wearable devices exist due to limited display area, battery life, renewable battery power, miniaturisation and integration, safety, security and privacy. Further important issues include reliability, software bugs and failure modes. But advancements in electronic product design, fabrication techniques, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and signal processing techniques facilitate the overcoming of the aforementioned challenging issues. Numerous research projects are in progress to provide solutions for limited memory, battery size, device shapes, data reliability, security concerns, and communication and networking protocols.

This special issue is primarily focused on wearable devices in terms of different sensing mechanisms, materials for sensing (including energy harvesting) and how artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and signal processing can be employed for ubiquitous computing in wearable devices.
