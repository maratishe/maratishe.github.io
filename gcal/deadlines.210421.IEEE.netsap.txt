We cordially invite you to submit your papers for the 11th IEEE International Workshop on Network Technologies for Security, Administration & Protection (NETSAP 2021).

https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/netsap-network-technologies-for-security-administration-protection/

This workshop aims to discuss and advance research and development of practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. The workshop focuses on development of practical systems and methodologies including measurement and analysis of real traffic and also privacy issues about network monitoring. The workshop addresses researchers from different disciplines in academia and industry, as well as practitioners, who share interests in countermeasures against cyber attacks.

Because of recent expansion of cyber attacks, many organizations and persons have been affected their activities on Internet. DDoS attacks to governmental sites, online trading/shopping sites are typical examples that many people cannot access to their desired information. Furthermore, there are many online services which offer DDoS attacks, so that attackers easily intimidate organizations to perform DDoS attacks.

Increase of targeted attacks and variant explosion of malwares make security systems difficult to detect such malicious activities. As the results, incidents of information leakages have silently and frequently occurred in many organizations.

In order to take countermeasures against the attacks, various types of systems have been proposed in literature. Although benchmark results and simulation experiments could show their good performance, most of the method could not be practically applicable to the real environment. Basically, this gap between in theory and practice is caused by too much benchmark-optimization on algorithms or by unrealistic assumptions on simulation settings.

In this workshop, we focus on practical systems to fight against cyber attacks. Mechanisms, algorithms and strategies that are used in the real field will be discussed. Measurement and analysis of real traffic is also welcomed for aiming at new direction of the future research. In addition to the practical systems, we would like discuss on privacy issues about network monitoring.

Any submission whose content is relevant to the area of network technologies for security, administration and protection will be considered, but any submission whose subject matter is related to one of the following topics will be particularly welcome:

• Intrusion Detection and Protection
• DoS Attack Detection and Protection
• Malware Analysis
• IP Traceback
• Digital Forensics
• Countermeasures against Advanced Persistent Threats
• Network Analytics for Security
• Privacy in Network Monitoring
• Trusted Computing
• Security Automation
• Security Visualization
• Cloud Security
• IoT Security
• Mobile Security

Important Dates

Workshop papers due: 21 April 2021

Workshop paper notifications: 15 May 2021

Camera-ready and registration due: 31 May 2021

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted.  In accordance with IEEE policy, submitted manuscripts will be checked for plagiarism. Instances of alleged misconduct will be handled according to the IEEE Publication Services and Product Board Operations Manual.

Please note that in order to ensure the fairness of the review process, COMPSAC follows the double-blind review procedure. Therefore we kindly ask authors to remove their names, affiliations and contacts from the header of their papers in the review version. Please also redact all references to authors’ names, affiliations or prior works from the paper when submitting papers for review. Once accepted, authors can then include their names, affiliations and contacts in the camera-ready revision of the paper, and put the references to their prior works back.
