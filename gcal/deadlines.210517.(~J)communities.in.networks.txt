Community structure is one of the most relevant features encountered in numerous real-world applications of networked systems. Despite the tremendous effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on this subject over the past few years to characterize, model, and analyze communities, more investigations are needed in order to better understand the impact of their structure and dynamics on networked systems. Therefore, the primary goal of this satellite workshop is to demonstrate the cutting-edge research advances on community structures in networks, in order to provide a landscape of research progresses and application potentials in related areas.

Papers ranging from a broad nature, to various aspects of community structure with strong algorithmic innovations, but also application-oriented works are solicited.

Topics relevant to this satellite session include, but are not limited to, the following:




Models of Communities

Embedding Models of Communities

Evolution/Temporal Communities

Dynamic and/of Communities

Community Detection

Communities in Uncertain Data

Entropy Metrics for Communities

Visual Representation of Communities

Parallel Algorithms for Communities

Hierarchy and Ego-Networks

Communities and Sampling

Communities and Controllability

Communities and Synchronization

Communities and Machine Learning

Communities and Resilience

Communities and Link Prediction

Communities in Social Networks

Communities in Multiplex

Communities in Economics & Finance

Communities in Epidemics

Communities in Rumor Spreading

Communities in Mobile Networks

Communities in Biological Networks

Communities in Brain

Communities in Technological Networks
