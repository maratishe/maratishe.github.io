CALL FOR PAPERS - IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2021 in conjunction with IEEE INFOCOM 2021

Webpage: https://infocom2021.ieee-infocom.org/ieee-global-internet-symposium



The IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium is the flagship event established and organized by the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), a joint committee of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) and the Internet Society (ISOC). From 1996 through 2002, the symposium was held in conjunction with IEEE GLOBECOM, and since 2003 has moved to be held in conjunction with IEEE INFOCOM (except 2020).



The GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in the current and the future Internet and Internet-related technologies. The focus of the GI symposium is on experimental systems over the Internet and the design of future global Internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent Internet, industrial Internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially in a global Internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies. In addition to the traditional research papers, we encourage papers with well thought-through concepts and positions, papers that contrast proposed approaches, papers that clarify and compare inherent differences between competing technologies, and heresies.



The topics of interest for the GI 2021 include but are not limited to the following:

·         Routing, switching, and addressing

·         Future Internet and next generation network architectures

·         Information-centric networking, Software defined networking, and network function virtualization

·         Wireless Internet and Internet technologies for 5G/6G

·         Data center network architectures and performance

·         Integration of in-network computation, cloud, and edge/fog computing

·         Machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics for intelligent Internet

·         Space-air-ground integrated network

·         Quantum Internet

·         Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine, sensor, and vehicular/drone networks

·         Industrial Internet and time-sensitive and deterministic networks

·         Integrating blockchain with distributed Internet edges

·         Energy-efficient green communications

·         Geo-distributed applications, consistency, and latency challenges

·         Content delivery and management

·         Internet exchanges, remote peering and peer-to-peer networks

·         Internet structure and analysis

·         Network-aware applications

·         Real-world Measurements and deployments

·         Distributed systems and novel distributed Internet applications

·         Online social networking

·         Internet measurement, modeling, and visualization

·         Large-scale network operations, management, and performance monitoring

·         Trust, security, privacy, and blockchain for the Internet

·         Anomaly, intrusion, and attack detection

·         Accountability, reliability, and resiliency for networks

·         Economic aspects of the Internet and network neutrality
