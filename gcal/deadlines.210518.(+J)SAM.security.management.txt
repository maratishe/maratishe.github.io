Dear Colleagues,



The 2021 International Conference on Security and Management (SAM'21) will be held in Las Vegas, USA, July 26 – 29, 2021.  It is my pleasure to invite you to submit your Paper, Poster, or Session/Workshop organization proposal.  The Proceedings will also be available online at the Congress site and will be removed when they are published as books by Springer. When the books are published, you can also access them online at Springer site. For further information, please click on http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam21.



In case of hesitation by some authors/speakers to travel during Year 2021 (due to Coronavirus/COVID-19), the CSCE Steering Committee has developed the following policy:



The author would provide his/her presentation to the Congress via an FTP web link (presentation video) as well as the PowerPoint slides, or
The author presents his/her talk via Skype/Zoom/... In this case, the presentation should not go over 15 minutes (i.e., this would allow 5 additional minutes for Q&A)


Important Dates (EXTENDED)
