Scope and Topics of Interest

We are in the age of big data. The availability of big data sets significantly promoted the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, big data poses fundamental concerns on security and privacy, especially the pervasive and powerful applications of artificial intelligence.

Big data security and privacy involves many booming fields, including, digital economy, e-health, automatic driving, robotics, and so on. Due to its brand new features and extraordinary scale, big data security and privacy faces many theoretical and application challenges, such as generative adversary networks, efficient encryption and decryption algorithms, encrypted information retrieval, attacks on availability, reliability and integrity, privacy aware machine learning, and privacy protection in big data information publication.



The purpose of this workshop is to offer a timely venue for researchers and industry partners in communications and networking domains to present and discuss their latest findings and results in security and privacy related work of big data.

We focus on the security and privacy issues in communications and networking fields from the following perspectives, but are not limited to:

·       Generative adversary networks

·       Federated learning

·       Machine learning

·       Artificial intelligence

·       Digital economy

·       Driverless vehicular systems

·       Internet of Things

·       Social networks

·       Blockchain systems

·       Cloud and fog systems

·       Threat and vulnerability analysis

·       Cryptography tools for privacy

·       Secure multiparty computing

·       Trust and forensics

·       Anonymous communication

·       E-health and aged care

·       Attacks and counter measures

·       Complex networks

·       Theoretical and practical architecture
