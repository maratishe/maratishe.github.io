Call for Paper

Since the development of Cloud Computing technology has deeply changed not only the development of computer science but also influenced the way people live. With Cloud-based technology, various kinds of mobile applications to big data-based services are provided to accelerate the data-oriented services. Today, one of the most promising trends is the Cloud-based solutions for small enterprises to deploy their business on Cloud servers. However, privacy and security issues along with the widely developed Cloud-based services are always becoming an obstacle for the usage of the Cloud services. Also, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies such as Deep Learning (DL) have brought new challenges to the traditional security and privacy issues on Cloud Computing. IEEE CSCloud 2020 focuses on these two aspects and aims to gather recent achievements in cybersecurity and cloud computing fields. The conference invites those papers that concentrate on new paradigms, algorithms, and applications in cybersecurity or cloud computing. We also encourage researchers and practitioners to build up the connections between academia and industry. We aim to collect the latest achievements and exchange research ideas in the domains of intelligent data and security at this academic event.



IEEE CSCloud 2021 is co-located with The 7th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2021)
