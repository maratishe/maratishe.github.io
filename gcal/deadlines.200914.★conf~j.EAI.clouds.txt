EAI is actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation to ensure the safety, comfort and quality of experience for attendees and a successful course of the event in 2020.

EAI CloudComp is also welcoming submissions from authors who will be unable to attend the event in person due to restrictions caused by COVID-19. Accepted Authors will have the opportunity to present their paper online in an interactive virtual conference track
that will be live-streamed to the entire EAI Community.

In case the situation prevents the event from taking place in its original location, it will be held fully in an interactive, live online setting. In both cases, all matters related to publication and indexing will remain unchanged.

Accepted Authors will be notified about the final decision regarding the conference format before the Camera-ready deadline.
