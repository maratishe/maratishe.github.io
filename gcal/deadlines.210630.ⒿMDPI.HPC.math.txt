Dear Colleagues,

We are organizing a special issue on "Current Trends in Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing (HPC) with their Mathematical Foundations" in Mathematics (top 10％ journal, JIF percentile 91.5％ in the "Mathematics" category of the JCR). We invite researchers to submit papers related to modern architectures, and algorithms, code analysis and synthesis techniques for high-performance computing, highlighting the mathematical concepts and applications that constitute the fundamental pillars of modern computer engineering.

Prof. Dr. Gabriel Rodríguez
Prof. Dr. Juan Touriño
Guest Editors


Important dates

Submission deadline: 30/06/2021
Publication: Immediate after acceptance (continuous publication, submissions allowed until the deadline)


Keywords

* Processor, memory, storage systems, and interconnection network architecture
* HPC programming models, systems, and infrastructures
* Code generation, translation, transformation, and optimization
* Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets
* Instruction, thread, and data-level parallelism
* Architectural support and modeling
* Effects of circuits or technology on architecture


Manuscript Submission Information

All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except for conference proceedings papers, which are acceptable provided that the extended version is at least 50％ novel with respect to the conference publication). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process.

Mathematics is a Gold Open Access journal. An article processing charge applies. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available at https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics/special_issues/Computer_Architecture_High_Performance_Computing/
