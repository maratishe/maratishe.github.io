Special Issue on Embracing Artificial Intelligence for Network and Service Management



https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp



(Submissions due: 1 April 2021)



Artificial Intelligence (AI) can harness the immense amount of operational data from clouds, to services, to social and communication networks. In the era of big data and connected devices of all varieties, artificial intelligence has found ways to improve operations and management of information technology services, systems and networks.



Research is therefore needed to understand and improve the potential and suitability of artificial intelligence in the context of services, systems and network management. This will provide deeper understanding and better decision making based on largely collected and available operational and service data. It will also present opportunities for improving artificial intelligence algorithms on aspects such as reliability, dependability and scalability, as well as demonstrate the benefits of these methods in management and control systems. Moreover, there is an opportunity to define novel platforms that can harness the vast operational data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to drive management decisions in networks, data centers, and clouds.



IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of four recent TNSM special issues on Data Analytics for Management in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 this special issue will also focus on recent, emerging approaches and technical models that exploits artificial intelligence in network and service management solutions. We welcome submissions addressing the underlying challenges and opportunities, presenting novel techniques, experimental results, or theoretical approaches motivated by management problems. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges and opportunities for future research are also in the scope of the special issue. We look forward to your submissions!
