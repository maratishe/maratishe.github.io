Scope and Topics of the Conference

The Next Generation Networks (NGN) and future Communication Systems design will be driven by human expectations on better services, which in turn increases management complexity for network providers. New networking technologies are needed to efficiently and effectively cope with the intricacy in traffic demands, especially with the increase of over-the-top (OTT) services provided by operators and individual companies.

The main focus of the HPSR 2021 – the 22nd edition of HPSR conference – will be to assess how breakthrough changes occurring to networks and telecom are affecting areas related to switching and routing, and communication networks in general. We are soliciting original and thought-provoking works on big data, data analytics, cloud services, and machine-learning techniques applied to networking and switching and routing. Works on autonomous networks, 5G and beyond, IoT, Industry 4.0, social networks, network, cybersecurity, virtualization, and other advanced topics are also welcome. Research works on the following topics, but not limited to, are welcome for submission:

•        Switching support to extended reality (including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality)

•        Routing and resource allocation for Tactile Internet

•        High-speed packet processors

•        Address lookup algorithms, packet classification, scheduling, and dropping

•        Efficient data structures for networking applications
