17th International Conference on Design of Reliable Communication Networks

Technically Co-Sponsored by IEEE Communications Society (IEEE ComSoc)

http://www.drcn2021.polimi.it

April 19-22, 2021 – Milan, Italy


SCOPE

Since its creation in 1998, the International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN) has become over the years a well-established forum for scientists from both industry and academy who have interest in reliability and availability of communication networks, and related resilience topics. The aim of the conference is to bring together people from various disciplines, ranging from engineering of survivable equipment and network technologies to network management and monitoring, through methods and models for survivable and robust network design. As such, DRCN is a well-known forum for presenting excellent results and new challenges in the field of reliable communication networks and services.



We are pleased to invite you to contribute and participate in the 17th edition of DRCN in Milan, Italy, on April 19-22, 2021.

Topics of interest for submission include, but are not limited to:

Resilience in 5G networks and services
Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC)
Design of resilient and reliable IoT systems
Resilience in Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Secure and reliable quantum communications
Resilience in satellite communication networks
High availability for Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) infrastructures
Network dependability in cloud networking
Dependability and reliability of wireless/cellular/mobile networks
Resilience in FSO/VLC communications
Survivability and traffic engineering for optical, IP and multi-layer networks
