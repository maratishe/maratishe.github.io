Embedding Internet of Everything in New-Age Smart Environments

****************************************************************************************

After the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) for scenarios requiring sensor monitoring, the research community has realized that specific environments require narrowing down technological solutions to particular study cases. Examples of these particular scenarios are the recently coined research areas of the Internet of People, Internet of Processes, Internet of Data or Internet of Vehicles, as spin-off fields of the IoT seed. It is understood that future electronics will be inherently connected in what is called the Internet of Everything (IoE), fostering the connectivity of all physical and virtual entities in the Future Internet.

However, the mere collection of sensor records could be useless without a proper treatment of data using, first, an efficient communication medium and, second, a proper infrastructure feeding services and final applications. The evolution from IoT to IoE, and the birth of all other IoX subfields, has lately been coupled with new communication technologies enabling connectivity to battery-powered constrained devices and, even more recently, to moving sensors. Common architectures requiring local communication gateways for Internet connectivity could be inefficient or directly inapplicable when monitoring moving “objects” in open spaces such as cities, maritime areas, agricultural fields or forests.

This Special Issue wants to exploit the momentum on IoE technologies for self-contained electronic devices addressed at current and upcoming smart spaces. For this, researchers are invited to contribute original works as well as review articles in topics covering sensor integration in IoE, low-power wireless communication technologies, sustainable and efficient IoT deployments, moving sensors and crowdsensing, 5G application in IoE and smart scenarios, and network protocols for new IoE scenarios.

Potential topics include but are not limited to:

- Low-power wide area networks for sensor connectivity;
- Mobile sensor networks;
- 5G technologies for massive machine type communications (mMTC);
- Embedded platforms for mobile monitoring;
- Connected wearables for crowdsensing;
- Internet of Vehicles;
- Self-contained sensory platforms for smart environments;
- Network slicing strategies for IoE;
- Internet of Everything platforms;
- Energy efficient IoE devices;
- Sustainable IoE deployments.
