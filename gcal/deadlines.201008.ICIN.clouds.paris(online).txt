COVID-19 Statement

ICIN 2021 is planned to be held in Paris on March 1-4th 2021. The organizing committee (OC) is closely monitoring the development of the COVID-19 situation that could impact paper submissions and in-person attendance. In case of travel restrictions, a partially or fully virtual conference could become necessary and video/remote presentations will be accepted. In addition, the OC is also investigating remote participation under all circumstances especially for accepted papers.


About ICIN

Since 1989, the ICIN conferences have been bringing together leading Internet and telecom experts from industry, academia and government from across the globe. ICIN is a single track conference that is both intimate and global, attracting 100+ delegates, from more than 20 countries. It focuses on leading edge investigations into Internet technologies, from basic networking and cloud services to novel architectures. ICIN uses a rigorous peer-review process and has become an established industry forum to discuss emerging trends in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It offers an agora for one-on-one discussions and cross-fertilization between participants and leading network visionaries, with the goal of promoting dialogue and ideation about the current and future trends in networking research and development. ICIN conferences are well known for their identification of research challenges and industry trends and their discussion on the impact of cutting-edge technologies on future intelligent and distributed networking, and related computing services. ICIN has an enviable track record of identifying key technologies and services – and analysing their impact on business models – before they become widely recognized in the industry and government communication sectors. The interdisciplinary approach and the cross-fertilization of ideas are the main ingredients that made ICIN a recognized event in the telecommunications, cloud networking and Internet communities.


ICIN 2021

For 2021 ICIN is focussing on the melding of network and computing services that is clearly demonstrated by the increasing softwarization of the network services in the core and the access networks, the rise of computing in the network and the growth of cognition in networking for management and control, as well as for value added services at the edge and in the data center. Several innovations are impacting the ongoing transformations toward the network of the future and the evolution of cloud services. More and more the network fabric itself emcompasses functionality usually associated with computing as increased intelligence and cognition are necessary to address emerging requirements of distributed services, automation and network reliability. At the same time, more and more, the cloud is extending to the edge adding a number of heterogeneous networked subsystems to the Internet with a variety of requirements that further highlight the need for novel architectures, e.g., IoT systems, augmented and virtual reality and service delivery platforms.

The result is the networking and computing systems becoming one, melding, as a distributed cloud/edge continuum with cognition and intelligence for emerging services. This “Computing and Networking as a Service” is the paradigm that will be central to the deployment of immersive services in many different sectors, such as e-health, self-driving cars, industrial networks, agriculture and cloud robotics. In this regard, there is a need for a variety of mechanisms enabling the new generation of service offerings at different levels (consumer, business, government, social, service provider ecosystem platforms).

In this scenario and considering the many challenges that the aforementioned paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2021 is:

"Services everywhere: melding networking and computing in an intelligent cloud-edge continuum"

The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future service concepts, service delivery and their enabling technologies and mechanisms in the emerging scenario of immersive intelligence and service level awareness. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of Computing as a Service technologies for different application service delivery platforms.

Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, research related to business impact or mechanisms of new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.

***********************************************************************************
ICIN 2021 solicits original, unpublished work not currently under review by other
conferences or journals. Papers submitted to ICIN 2021 will be assessed based on
originality, technical soundness, clarity and interest to a wide audience. All
submissions must be written in English and must use standard IEEE two-column
conference template, available for download from the IEEE website:

https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html

Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process and all submissions must
be done electronically through EDAS using the following link:

http://edas.info/N27469

Technical papers can be of two types: full papers or short papers, up to 8 pages
and 5 pages respectively, including tables, figures and references. Demo papers
of length of 3 pages are also solicited.

For further information about demo submissions, please check the conference website:
https://www.icin-conference.org/133-2/

At least one author is required to register, at the full rate, to present
accepted papers at the conference and for the paper to appear in the conference
proceedings.

The best technical papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit
an extended version for fast-track review in the following journals:
- IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management (Impact Factor: 3.878)
- MDPI Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.275)
Extended versions of ICIN 2020 papers must include at least 30% of new material
(algorithms, results, related work) compared to the conference version.
