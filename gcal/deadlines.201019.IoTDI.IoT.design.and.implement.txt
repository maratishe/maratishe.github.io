SCOPE AND TOPICS

The organizers of IoTDI 2021 are pleased to announce the organization of
IoTDI 2021, and are soliciting high-quality papers for the conference.
The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things Design and
Implementation (IoTDI) is a premier venue on IoT. In 2021, IoTDI will
be held for the sixth time, and will be part of CPS-IoT WEEK 2021 being
organized in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

A confluence of technological advances marks the advent of a new era.
World data volume is growing at an unprecedented pace, much of it from
embedded devices. Smart cities are expected to grow, fed by millions of
data points from multitudes of human and physical sources. Cyber-attacks
grow more nefarious, bringing down physical systems. Social networks are
becoming ubiquitous, offering information on physical things. The separation
between cyber, physical, and social systems is blurring. Collectively, these
developments lead to the emergence of a new field, where the networking and
physical realms meet. It is the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). This
conference is an interdisciplinary forum to discuss challenges, technologies,
and emerging directions in system design and implementation that pertain to
IoT. This conference invites researchers and practitioners from academia,
industry and government, and accepts original, previously unpublished work
on a range of topics related to IoT.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Analytic foundations and theory of IoT
* Reliability, security, timeliness, and robustness in IoT systems
* Novel protocols and network abstractions
* Data streaming architectures and machine learning analytics for IoT
* IoT-motivated cyber-physical and Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems
* Novel quality requirements and their enforcement mechanisms
* Cloud back-ends and resource management for IoT applications
* Edge and fog computing
* Personal, wearable, and other embedded networked front-ends
* Social computing and human-in-the-loop issues
* Applications domains (e.g., smart cities, smart health, smart buildings,
smart transportation)
* Deployment experiences, case studies & lessons learned
* Evaluation and testbeds
* AI/ML for IoT & Embedded Systems
* Energy/Power Management & Harvesting for IoT Platforms

Accepted papers of particular merit will be invited to submit an extended
version to the IEEE IoT Journal (IoT-J). For papers reporting results based
on experiments with human subjects, appropriate ethics approvals should be
demonstrated as part of the submission.

CPS-IoT WEEK 2021

CPS-IoT Week (https://sigbed.org/cps-iot2020-2/) is the premier event on
Cyber-Physical Systems. This year it brings together four conferences, HSCC,
ICCPS, IPSN and RTAS, three guest conferences, IC2E, ICFC and IoTDI, multiple
workshops, tutorials, competitions and various exhibitions from both industry
and academia.
