*************************************************************************
The 2020 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC 2020)
December 16–18, 2020 | Virtual Conference

Posters are especially suited for presenting controversial research directions
that may generate discussion, or promising ideas not yet fully validated
through complete extensive evaluation.

Demonstration (demo) papers are suited for researchers to showcase their latest
prototypes with media, models, or live demonstrations. The demo session will be
co-located with the poster session to ensure maximum visibility and a close
interaction with the conference audience.

Poster/demo papers should be 2-page papers following standard IEEE 2-column
format using 10-point font. All paper submissions must be written in English.
The title of the paper should begin with either "Poster:" or "Demo:”.
