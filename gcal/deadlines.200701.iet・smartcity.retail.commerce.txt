Currently smart retail and e-commence have been experiencing an
exponential growth and becoming an irresistible trend worldwide. This
calls for sophisticated technologies from a wide spectrum of areas
including the Internet of Things, big data, information retrieval,
artificial intelligence, statistics to explore how to effectively take
advantage of such high-volume data such as price, ratings, title,
description, user preference, location, payment, and logistics, to
drive sales and improve shopping experience. For example, with mobile
payment, retail enterprises comprehensively gain insight into consumer
demands in a digitized way and have reshaped the user interactions
with the online platforms, which eventually improve sale volumes from
both online and offline retails. Retailers should be taking advantage
of the smart cities around the world to connect with the shopper of
the future. This Special Issue focuses on data driven business
analytics approaches and related system development for understanding
consumer behaviour, including intelligent retail operation,
intelligent CRM, marketing, advertising, promotion, user interface,
and so on. This Special Issue is open for submission of up-to-date and
high-quality research and application contributions from wide range of
professions including scholars, researchers, academicians and Industry
people. Original R&D papers, case studies and state-of-the-art reviews

ground for further research and technological improvements in this
important area.
