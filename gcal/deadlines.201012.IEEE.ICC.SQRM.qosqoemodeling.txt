Scope
The Communication QoS, Reliability and Modeling (CQRM) Symposium aims at providing an international venue for the discussion of research advances in communications service provisioning, quality of service/experience technologies, modeling and formal methods, and analytical and experimental techniques to allow the design of communication networks as a reliable information infrastructure with QoS capability. The scope of this symposium is agnostic to network technologies. Specifically, the goal is to address the key challenges to provide the required level of QoS, security, and reliability to coexisting networks that are heterogeneous in nature, in size, and in the type of information transmitted.
Topics of interest for the CQRM Symposium include, but are not limited to:
• Metrics and Models for Quality of Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service (QoS)
• Human Perception Aware QoE
• QoS Provisioning in Machine Communications
• Design and Evaluation of Energy Efficient Networks and Services
