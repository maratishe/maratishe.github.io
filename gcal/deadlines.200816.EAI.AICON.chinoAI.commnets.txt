SCOPE

AICON 2020 is meant to stimulate the debate and provide a forum for researchers working on related problems, to exchange ideas and recent results (both positive and negative ones) in applying artificial intelligence to communications and networks. Both supervised learning and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and recent developments in generative adversarial networks, and game-theoretic setups are also of great interests.

We are pleased to invite you to submit your papers to AICON 2020. Submissions should be in English, following the Springer formatting guidelines (see Initial Submission).

AICON 2020 will take place online due to safety concerns and travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. Although we will miss having everyone meet and connect in person, we feel strongly that knowledge exchange must continue, if not more so. That is why we have equipped our online conferences with live viewing with chat, virtual Q&A, and a multitude of other measures to provide you with a great experience. All of this while making the registration for co-authors and non-authors completely free to give you the biggest possible audience. You can learn more about EAI’s online conferences here.
