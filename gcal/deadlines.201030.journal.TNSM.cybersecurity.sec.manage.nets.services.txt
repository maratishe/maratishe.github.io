CALL FOR PAPERS
IEEE TNSM SPECIAL ISSUE ON LATEST DEVELOPMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF NETWORKS AND SERVICES
https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp

-----------------------------------

Submission Deadline: October 30, 2020 (extended)

Dear Colleagues:

We cordially invite you to share your latest research results by submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management Special Issue on "Latest Developments for Security Management of Networks and Services".

------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
------------------------

As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.

These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.

IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services. We welcome submissions addressing the important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!

SUBMISSION FORMAT
------------------------

Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, presentation, relevance and contribution to the field of management of software-defined virtualized systems, as well as their overall quality and suitability for the special issue. The submitted papers must be written in good English and describe original research which has not been published nor currently under review by other journals or conferences. Previously published conference papers should be clearly identified by the authors at the initial submission stage and an explanation should be provided of how such papers have been extended in order to be considered for this special issue.

Author guidelines for preparation of the manuscript can be found at:
