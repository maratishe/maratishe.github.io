Cloud  Networking  has emerged  as a promising  direction for
cost-efficient  and  reliable  service  delivery across  data
communication  networks.  The  dynamic  location  of  service
facilities and the  virtualization  of hardware and  software
elements   are   stressing   the  communication  network  and
protocols,  especially when  data centers  are interconnected
through  the  Internet.  Emerging  technologies  like Network
Function  Virtualization (NFV)  and  Software Defined Network
(SDN)  can play significant roles by improving the dynamicity
and  programmability  of  cloud  networks. Middlebox has been
significantly   improved   the   agility  of  cloud   network
deployment   and   management.  The  9th  IEEE  International
Conference on Cloud Networking (IEEE CloudNet 2020),  part of
the IEEE  Cloud  Computing  Initiative,  can  greatly promote
research in cloud networks and emerging research areas.
