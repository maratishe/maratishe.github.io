The International Teletraffic Congress ITC 33, to be held during 31/08-03/09 2021, at the Avignon University, France, is the 33th edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks in a holistic way. Since then, it has established a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.

ITC 33 focuses on the future networks taking advantage of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), towards “AI-integrated Networks”. Indeed, service providers from all over the world are already reaping the benefits of integrating AI into their networks. For ITC 33, cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering and control with application also to emerging softwarized/virtualized network paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenarios brought about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. We especially encourage original contributions which bridge the gap between performance modeling and real-life operational aspects, including works which leverage measurement data to provide a better understanding of the wired and wireless networks operation under realistic conditions.

ITC 33 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. ITC 33 is structured into eight different areas. The objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and green IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience. The technical sessions will be structured around, but are not limited to, the following topics:

• Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization
• Network Measurements and Big Data
• Networking Architectures and Paradigms
• Wireless and Cellular Networks
• Data Center Networking for Cloud Computing Design and Operation
• Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization
• Networking for Edge and Fog Computing
• Network Economics

Besides the general submissions, ITC33 encourages submissions for the *Ph.D. workshop* and special sessions which will be detailed in the upcoming communications. Finally, ITC 33 will offer a number of *student travel grants* that will be available to support full-time students for attending the conference. A dedicated call for workshops will be detailed in the upcoming communications.

The conference will feature a best paper award and a best student paper award. Papers receiving best paper awards of the conference will be invited for fast-track reviews by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering.
