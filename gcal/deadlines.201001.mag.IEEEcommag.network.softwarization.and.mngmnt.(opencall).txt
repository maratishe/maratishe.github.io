Network Softwarization and Management Series


=====================================================================================

This series focuses on softwarization, management, and their integration in communication networks and
their services. “Network softwarization” advocates for architectures that separate the software implementing
network functions, protocols and services from the hardware running them. Propelled by the maturity of
technologies like network function virtualization and software-defined networking, softwarization is radically
changing the way communication infrastructures are designed and operated enabling rapid and innovative
service creation. “Network management“ is about administering networks and supporting their operations.
It aims to integrate fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security management in the network;
to leverage the self-management, automation and autonomic capabilities of networks, and to move from a
“managed object” paradigm to a “management by objective” one.

The key role that software and management are increasingly playing in telecommunications is enabling
unprecedented levels of abstraction, disaggregation, operation, integration, and programmability in
network infrastructures and services. This Series publishes in-depth, cutting-edge, articles on state-
of-the-art technologies and solutions bringing together the latest advances, innovations, open-source
projects, case studies, research, and development in Network Softwarization and Management.

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in all topics within the scope of this Series including, but
not limited to, the following:

Submission Guidelines

Manuscripts must be submitted through the magazine’s submissions website, Manuscript Central
(<mc.manuscriptcentral.com/commag-ieee>). You will need to register and then proceed to the author
center. On the manuscript details page, please select the Network Softwarization and Management Series
from the drop-down menu. Manuscripts should be  scientific-oriented and should not be under review for
any other conference or journal. They should be written in a style comprehensible and accessible to readers
outside the specialty of the article.  Mathematical equations should not be used. For detailed submission
guidelines please refer to the magazine website for the list of Paper Submission Guidelines
(<comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine/author-guidelines/manuscript-submission>)
that must be followed by all submissions to the IEEE Communications Magazine.

Papers can be submitted anytime during the year. They will receive a review process, and, if accepted,
they will be published in the first slot available for this Series.
