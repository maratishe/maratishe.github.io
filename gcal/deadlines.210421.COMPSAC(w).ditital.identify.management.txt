Call for Papers:

Secure digital identity management, required by cloud services,
federated services, or newest distributed and decentralized
technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledger
technologies, is receiving increasing attention from both service
providers' and end users' perspectives, in terms of protection of
enterprise assets and customers' privacy in the cloud, respectively.
This workshop solicits contributions describing state-of-the-art
methodology and technology innovations in the field of secure
identity management, encourages experience sharing (both positive
and negative ones), and also welcomes work-in-progress ideas
towards future concepts.

The workshop is dedicated to the security and privacy aspects of
identity management (IDM) in smart devices, the cloud, or blockchain
and distributed ledger environment. Topics are articulated around
several important themes as "concept design," "enabling technologies,"
"federated identities," "decentralized identities" and "applications."
It is expected they will attract both theoretical and empirical works
from the IDM society, the cloud computing society, and the
decentralized identity management society.

This year, we welcome also contributions on how secure and privacy
-preserving identity management can help in infection control of
COVID19, such as immunity pass, vaccine certificate, and convenient
access control in the healthcare facilities.


Scope of the Workshop:

Any submission whose content is relevant to the area of secure
identity management will be considered, but any submission
whose subject matter is related to one of the following topics
will be particularly welcome.
Practically-oriented approaches will also be appreciated.

* Identity-based access control and personal data management
* Data provenance
* Identity attributes processing and analysis in a protected domain
* Service-oriented architecture for IDM in cloud
* Identity federations & trust fabrics
* Cryptographic methods for IDM
* PKI architecture, security policy, and operation method
* Identity management in the IoT environment
* IDM on a blockchain, self-sovereign identity or other
decentralized identity platform
* Anonymization, pseudonymization, and other privacy/data
protection methods
* Legal, ethical, and socioeconomic aspects
