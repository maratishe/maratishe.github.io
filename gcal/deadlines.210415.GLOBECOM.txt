CALL FOR PAPERS TECHNICAL SYMPOSIA
IoT and Sensor Networks

SCOPE AND MOTIVATION
With the promise of revolutionizing the way we live, work and
manufacture, it is no surprise why the Internet of Things (IoT) has
picked up the momentum in both industry and academia. Thanks to the
increased connectivity and the continued miniaturization of computers
and smart devices, IoT will generate huge volumes of data that will have
to be analyzed to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other
insights. Moreover, in the industrial environments (Industry 4.0) as
well in smart spaces (building, houses, etc.) and connected cars
communications will require higher reliability, lower latency and
scalability. Several technologies such as BLE, Zigbee, WirelessHART,
IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH, 6TiSCH, LPWAN (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M etc.)
RAW have been proposed to tackle these requirements. The forthcoming 5G
networks promise not only increased data rates but also ultra-low data
latency communication for critical IoT applications that require extreme
reliability. 5G will enable Machine Type Communication (MTC) one of the
most promising technologies for IoT applications which is gaining a
tremendous interest among mobile network operators, equipment vendors,
MTC specialist companies, and research bodies. This anticipated
high-traffic demands, low-latency and deterministic delivery
requirements stemming from IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M)
communications can be met only with radical changes in terms of
architecture and communication solutions. Recently, Fog/Edge-to-thing
continuum is proposed to mitigate the heavy burden on the network due to
the centralized processing and storing of the massive IoT data.
Fog/Edge-enabled IoT architectures ensure closer processing in proximity
to the things, which results in small, deterministic latency that
enables real-time applications and enforced security.
The IoT and Sensor Networks Symposium at IEEE Globecom 2021 aims
at a forum that brings together scientists and researchers to present
their cutting-edge innovations in all aspects of the field. This track
solicits technical papers describing original, previously unpublished
