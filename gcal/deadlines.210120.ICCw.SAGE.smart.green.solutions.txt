** Scope and motivation



As the number of communication devices and data demands are growing, awareness

of the value of wireless communication gadgets has also tremendously increased.

The need for higher agricultural productivity, industrial automation, clean air

and clean water, convenient and safe city life, surveillance are some aspects

that call for deployment of IoT devices for autonomous monitoring and actuation.

Realization of large-scale deployment hinge upon green and energy-sustainable

operation of the devices. In this framework, the SAGE workshop aims to draw

together researchers and practitioners engaged in the progress and continued

endeavors on such technology solutions. It focuses on the energy sustainability

aspects of IoT and, in general, on machine‐type communications, actuation, and

control automation in smart environments, which is a major theme of 5G+ and 6G

technologies. Beyond theoretical studies, the interest is on technology viability

of green and energy‐sustainable communication solutions ranging from low‐rate

telemetric communications to highly‐reliable, ultra‐low latency, and bandwidth‐

intensive communications.





** Keynote Speakers:
