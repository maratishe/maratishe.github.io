Dear Colleagues,



The 2021 International Conference on Security and Management (SAM'21) will be held in Las Vegas, USA, July 26 – 29, 2021.  It is my pleasure to invite you to submit your Paper, Poster, or Session/Workshop organization proposal.  Please find attached the “Call For Papers,” “Call For Sessions,” and “Call For Posters.  For further information, please click on http://sam.udmercy.edu/sam21.



In case of hesitation by some authors/speakers to travel during Year 2021 (due to Coronavirus/COVID-19), the CSCE Steering Committee has developed the following policy:



The author would provide his/her presentation to the congress via an FTP web link (presentation video) as well as the PowerPoint slides, or
The author presents his/her talk via Skype/Zoom/... In this case, the presentation should not go over 15 minutes (i.e., this would allow 5 additional minutes for Q&A)
