Towards Reliable and Scalable Smart Cities

Smart Cities offer the potential to revolutionize a range of applications within today's society in areas such as healthcare, energy management, transportation, security, and smart buildings. This potential is built upon an intricate technical infrastructure including smart sensing/devices/materials, IoT, networking, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, and mobile cloud services. As such, SCI2021 will provide the opportunity for researchers to discuss the state-of-the-art from both a technical and application perspective. The Conference aims to provide a unique platform for multi-disciplinary researchers and teams, industry solution vendors, and government agencies to exchange innovative ideas, challenges, research results and solutions.

The Conference will include a highly selective program of technical papers, accompanied by workshops and keynote presentations. Original contributions are welcome from both a technical and application perspective. The theme of the 2021 edition will be to investigate how Smart City Innovations can manage issues surrounding reliability in addition to considering how ideas and concepts can be deployed on a large scale.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

Theory, Modeling, and Methodologies
-Smart city networking, services and infrastructures, and reliability
-Smart environment modeling, monitoring, prediction, and analysis
-Smart city frameworks and platforms
-Smart city big data, open data, and urban computing
-Smart utilities, consumption, sensing, and IoT
-Smart communities and neighborhoods
-Modeling security, safety, and privacy for smart cities

Applications and Industry Practice
-Smart transportation system planning, evaluation, and technologies
-Smart city sewage, water, and electricity management
-Smart city healthcare service monitoring
-Smart city emergency altering, management, and infrastructures
-Smart city crime watching
-Smart city education, training, and social services
