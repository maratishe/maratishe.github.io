COMPSAC 2021
INTELLIGENT & RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD
https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/
JULY 12-16, 2021

***CALL FOR PAPERS***

MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 12, 2021

Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis.  Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication.  Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely.  These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities.  But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered.  Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently.  In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses.  As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported.  How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing.  How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users?  For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!

COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.

Scope of the Session:
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!

CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue on 6G Technologies and Applications - IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (Impact Factor: 7.921)

Submission deadline: April 5th, 2021

5G networks have made a significant step towards developing a low latency tactile access network and open new opportunities for innovative automation of network resources and operations. As we progress on the deployment of 5G, work to define what 6G networks should be is under way. First ideas were presented in the first two 6G special issues published in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (September 2019 and December 2020, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209). This 6G series will lay down the concepts, basic functionalities, supported services and break-through technologies for 6G networks. The next generation of communications networks will resemble the nervous system making use of new spectrum to create new smart infrastructures that feature proactive, secure and adaptive paradigms that can be enabled by AI/ML. Smart 6G networks should address energy efficiency in the telecommunications’ sector and contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the goals of the European Green Deal, among others. With the increase of large autonomy of systems, the protection of the ‘nervous system’ against malicious attacks becomes also important. Moreover, the system autonomy and the large number of distributed sensor systems demand the simultaneous integration of distributed policies and new energy harvesting concepts. The move to machine-type communication demands radically separation of service processing and probably higher strict KPIs. These technologies and challenges will be considered within the context of 6G networks. This series is sponsored by the IEEE Future Networks initiative and is aimed at helping the research and industrial communities define and shape the architecture, technologies and services for 6G networks. We are soliciting original contributions that have not been published and are not currently under consideration by any other publications or conferences.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- 6G Dimensions and KPI requirements
- Methods and technologies to harness new spectrum
- AI/ML assisted PHY and networking
- MU-MIMO and new antenna technologies
- New medium access technologies
- 6G networks and solutions including 6G-U and private networks
- New core network entities and interfaces
- Network assurance and service provisioning
- AI/ML for 6G network management
- Cloudification, big data, orchestration, multi-access edge computing and IoT
- Cyber security and encrypted connectivity
- Wireless Networking using the optical spectrum – LiFi, visible light communications (VLC), optical camera communication (OCC) and free-space optical (FSO) communications
- Quantum communications
- Terahertz communications
- Green 6G networks, wireless harvesting technologies and energy efficiency
- 6G satellite and UAV networks
- 6G-enabled vertical applications and services

Submissions should clearly identify how they relate to 6G and how they would progress beyond current 5G technologies. Submitted papers should contain state-of-the-art research or technical material presented in a tutorial or survey style. All manuscripts must adhere to the IEEE VTM guidelines at http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtmagazine/submission.php. Authors should submit a PDF version of their manuscript to (select Special Issue when submitting) http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vtm-ieee

-----------------------Call for Papers-------------------------------------- 

The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021),
IEEE-CS TCI

23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy

http://www.ficloud.org/2021/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.

IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.

The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.

MDPI Sensors - Special Issue

Artificial Intelligence of Things for Real-Time Data Monitoring and Processing

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/aiotd



Call for Papers

The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we interact with our devices at home, at work, and throughout our cities. The number of IoT devices that continuously gather data from our environment is exponentially increasing, and so is the amount of data obtained. The potential value of the data is proportional to the capacity of analyzing it and making rapid decisions. Therefore, new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are needed to intelligently let the devices learn, reason, and process the information without human interaction. In this way, the devices become smart, being able to take actions and/or make decisions in real time on their own, as humans do. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a promising paradigm that enables the use of data analytics to optimize a system and generate higher performance by making better decisions in the device itself without using the cloud. In this way, less data needs to be transferred to the cloud and decisions can be made faster. However, limited resources and IoT device capabilities pose significant challenges in supporting AI.


This Special Issue solicits high-quality unpublished work on recent advances in real-time data monitoring and processing using lightweight AI on the IoT device itself. It welcomes theoretical contributions as well as applications in the area of AIoT. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:


    * Energy-efficient artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms;

    * Neuromorphic hardware and computing for IoT devices;

    * Edge computing-enabled AI;

    * Internet of Intelligent Things;

    * Machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making for IoT;

    * Real-time IoT data analytics;

    * Applications using AIoT.

================================
   Scope, Aims, and Topics
================================
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.

Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.

The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.

For this special issue to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586) related to the INDIS workshop, we encourage research papers that address one or more of the following networking research challenges; and developments that are essential in the information systems infrastructure for the scientific discovery process. Participants to the workshop are invited to submit extended versions of their accepted papers. We also welcome new paper submissions on related topics.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Data-intensive distributed application architectures
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in service of data science applications
- High-performance data transfer applications and techniques
- Science DMZs and other campus network architecture constructs

CALL FOR PAPERS TECHNICAL SYMPOSIA
IoT and Sensor Networks

SCOPE AND MOTIVATION
        With the promise of revolutionizing the way we live, work and
manufacture, it is no surprise why the Internet of Things (IoT) has
picked up the momentum in both industry and academia. Thanks to the
increased connectivity and the continued miniaturization of computers
and smart devices, IoT will generate huge volumes of data that will have
to be analyzed to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other
insights. Moreover, in the industrial environments (Industry 4.0) as
well in smart spaces (building, houses, etc.) and connected cars
communications will require higher reliability, lower latency and
scalability. Several technologies such as BLE, Zigbee, WirelessHART,
IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH, 6TiSCH, LPWAN (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M etc.)
RAW have been proposed to tackle these requirements. The forthcoming 5G
networks promise not only increased data rates but also ultra-low data
latency communication for critical IoT applications that require extreme
reliability. 5G will enable Machine Type Communication (MTC) one of the
most promising technologies for IoT applications which is gaining a
tremendous interest among mobile network operators, equipment vendors,
MTC specialist companies, and research bodies. This anticipated
high-traffic demands, low-latency and deterministic delivery
requirements stemming from IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M)
communications can be met only with radical changes in terms of
architecture and communication solutions. Recently, Fog/Edge-to-thing
continuum is proposed to mitigate the heavy burden on the network due to
the centralized processing and storing of the massive IoT data.
Fog/Edge-enabled IoT architectures ensure closer processing in proximity
to the things, which results in small, deterministic latency that
enables real-time applications and enforced security.
        The IoT and Sensor Networks Symposium at IEEE Globecom 2021 aims
at a forum that brings together scientists and researchers to present
their cutting-edge innovations in all aspects of the field. This track
solicits technical papers describing original, previously unpublished
papers pertaining to trends, issues and challenges of the Internet of
Things. You are invited to submit your research paper(s) related to the
