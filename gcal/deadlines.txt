** CALL FOR PAPERS ** IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop: Emerging Topics in 6G Communications

Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home

Venue: International Workshop on Emerging Topics in 6G Communications (ET_6G) which will be held at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC2021) on 14 June 2021.

5G networks and devices are now a reality with wide deployment and spread among population, but the demand for more data rate is still booming, and will soon need for a newer generation for wireless/cellular communication, the 6G. It will be a new standard that not only provides huge data rate (+1Tbps) and extremely low delay (0.1ms), but also will enable the “hyper-connected” paradigm that will connect users and things. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a major role within 6G, and thus more computation and communication resources will be consumed, where their optimization is a must. 

6G communications will bring new challenges due to their sensitivity to scenario conditions, thereby requiring highly adaptive techniques that will adapt extremely fast, in order to guarantee a delay less than 100 microseconds. Spectrum and resources management will be crucial within 6G in order to account for the extremely heterogeneous scenario. The networks complexity will also be unprecedented, due to the very diverse applications such as ultra‐low latency requirements for critical vehicle communication, the growing demand of high positioning accuracy for location‐based services, and dense heterogeneous architectures. Several emerging topics are encountered within 6G and this workshop will focus on such emerging topics, and potential solutions will be presented. Researchers and engineers from academia and industry are invited to submit their recent results and innovations. The list of topics includes, but not restricted to the following topics: 

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for 6G communications.
    Novel signal processing techniques for 6G communications.
    Smart Antenna schemes for 6G communications.
    6G communications at the Terahertz band.
    Advanced Full Duplex strategies for 6G.
    Meta-surfaces implementation at 6G communication.
    New Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for 6G communications.
    Multiple Access schemes suitable to 6G.
    Dynamic spectrum access/sharing at 6G band.
    New network architectures in 6G.
    Self-organizing 6G-enabled IoT. 
    Interference management at 6G.
    New security concepts within 6G. 
    Spectrum regulatory for 6G bands.
    6G Testbeds and Applications.

=========================================================================
5TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOG AND EDGE COMPUTING (ICFEC 2021)
10-13 May 2021, Melbourne, Australia
In conjunction with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021
URL: https://icfec2021.eeecs.qub.ac.uk
=========================================================================

We are delighted to invite you for the 5th IEEE International
Conference on Fog and Edge Computing to be held in Melbourne,
Australia. The conference will be held as part of and in conjunction
with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society and ACM.

INTRODUCTION
Billions of devices and sensors ranging from user gadgets to more
complex systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, such as power
grids or vehicles, from the physical world are getting connected to
the Internet. However, the need to operate the scale of heterogeneous
devices and sensors while being performance-efficient in real-time is
challenging. Typically, the data generated by the devices and sensors
are transferred to and processed centrally by services hosted on
geographically distant clouds. This is untenable given the
communication latency incurred and the ingress bandwidth demand.

A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry
experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources
located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the
cloud and the edge. These edge resources may be geographically or in
the network topology be closer to devices and sensors, such as home
router, gateways or more substantial micro data centers. Edge
resources may be used to offload selected services from the cloud to
accelerate an application or host edge-native applications. The
paradigm within which the edge is harnessed is referred to as
'Fog/Edge computing'.

The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of
service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing,
and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between
these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources,
which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization
and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management.
Extensions to current programming and storage models are required and
new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel
applications that can benefit from massively distributed and
data-driven systems need to be developed. Addressing security, privacy
and trust of the edge resources is of paramount importance while
managing the resources and context for mobile, transient and hardware
constrained resources. Lastly, emerging domains like autonomous
vehicles and machine/deep learning need to be supported over such
platforms.

CALL FOR PAPERS
The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering
both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific
applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use
the edge. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:
*       Data centers and infrastructures for Fog/Edge computing
*       Middleware and runtime systems for Fog/Edge infrastructures
*       Programming models for Fog/Edge computing
*       Storage and data management platforms for Fog/Edge computing
*       Scheduling for Fog/Edge infrastructures
*       Distributed and federated machine learning on Fog/Edge
*       Performance monitoring and metering of Fog/Edge infrastructures
*       Legal issues and business aspects of Fog/Edge computing
*       Security, privacy, trust and provenance issues in Fog/Edge computing
*       Modeling and simulation of Fog/Edge environments
*       Novel, latency-sensitive and locality-critical applications of
Fog/Edge computing

Springer AI & SOCIETY - Special issue on AI for People


- Abstract submission: January 31, 2021  

- Manuscript submission: April 30, 2021 


https://www.springer.com/journal/146/updates/18583616



We invite contributions to a Special Issue on AI for People, to be published by the AI & Society - Journal of Culture, Knowledge and Communication (Springer) https://www.springer.com/journal/146​. 


This Special Issue was born out of the idea of shaping Artificial Intelligence technology around human and societal needs.  We believe that technology should respect the anthropocentric principle. It should be at the service of the people, not vice-versa. In order to foster this idea, we need to narrow the gap between civil society and technical experts. This gap is one in knowledge, in action and in tools for change.



=============================

SPECIAL ISSUE THEMES

=============================

The ‘social good’ is something which benefits the general public, being ‘for’ the people, and at the same time, it is something which reflects and respects their wishes, being ‘from’ the people. The ‘social good’ can be envisioned as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals through collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approaches to be used and play a crucial role in the  aforementioned ‘social good’, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development and sustainability.  

Nowadays, advances in research on AI systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse about the applicability of the AI Ethics principles when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems. AI Ethical principles are guidelines put  forward by policy makers that can act as abstractions, as normative constraints on the do’s and don’ts of algorithmic use in  society. Themes of transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy must be taken into  account when deploying real-world AI systems.    


This Special Issue will focus on the following AI Ethics principles:  

   1. Accuracy and Robustness: algorithmic conclusions are probabilities and therefore not infallible and they also  might incur in errors during execution. This can lead to unjustified actions.  

   2. Explainability and Transparency: a lack of interpretability and transparency can lead to algorithmic systems that  are hard to control, monitor, and correct. This is the commonly called ‘black-box’ issue.  

   3. Bias and Fairness: conclusions can only be as reliable (but also as neutral) as the data they are based on, and this  can lead to bias. An action could be found to be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on one group of  people.  

   4. Privacy: algorithmic activities, like profiling, can lead to challenges for autonomy and informational privacy.    

   5. Accountability: it is hard to assign responsibility to algorithmic harms and this can lead to issues with moral  responsibility.   

   6. Safety and Security: AI systems need to respect and support privacy rights and data protection while ensuring the  security of data.  


The aim of this Special Issue is, however broad, mostly twofold. On one hand, it entails the technical realization of these  AI Ethics principles (one or more) in practice. For example, this might refer to specific techniques to ensure principles like ‘fairness’ in an algorithm, with their related practical challenges. On the other hand, it entails addressing these principles  from a conceptual standpoint. For example, this might entail, among other things, theorizing, analysing, criticizing and/or  further developing the AI principles themselves. Contributions are welcomed from a host of different disciplines, spanning  from the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.  



=============================

CONTRIBUTION TYPES

=============================

We welcome contributions across the following formats:  

   - Original​ papers (max 10k words): substantial contribution, theory, method, application. Contributions may be  experimental, based on case studies, or conceptual discussions of how AI systems affect organisations, society  and humans. Original papers will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.    

   - Open Forum​ papers (max 8k words): research in progress, ideas paper. Contributions may come from researchers,  practitioners and others interested in the topics of the special issue. Contributions might be, but not limited to, discussion papers, literature reviews, case studies, working papers, features, and articles on emerging research. Papers published in the open forum target a broad audience i.e. academics, designers as well as the average reader.  Open Forum contributions will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.    

   - Student​ papers (max 6k words): research in progress. Contributions may come from post-graduate students and  Ph.D. students interested in the topics of the special issue. For articles that are based primarily on the student’s  dissertation or thesis, it is recommended that the student is usually listed as principal author. Papers are double  blind peer-reviewed by one reviewer and the editorial team.    

   - Curmudgeon​ papers (max 1k words): short opinionated column on trends in technology, science and society,  commenting on issues of concern to the research community and wider society. Whilst the drive for artificial  intelligence promotes potential benefits to wider society, it also raises deep concerns of existential risk, thereby  highlighting the need for an ongoing conversation between technology and society. At the core of Curmudgeon  concern is the question: What are the political-philosophical concepts regarding the present sphere of AI  technology? Curmudgeon articles will be reviewed by the Journal editors.

Special issue on

Cybersecurity Management in the era of AI

***Submissions are due: Dec. 21st, 2020***

https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838

We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.

Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.

Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber-attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.

This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI.

Encouraged by the successful demonstrations of projects such as the U-Space and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), the aviation industry around the world is moving towards more advanced applications of air mobility including services such as air taxi and air ambulance. At the same time, the academic research community is finding new challenges to address in high-density, low altitude flying UASs.

Advanced aerial mobility refers to “transformative and disruptive new airborne technology supporting an ecosystem designed to transport people and things to locations not traditionally served by current modes of air transportation, including both rural and the more challenging and complex urban environments”, according to the National Academies Press. The platforms that are being developed for advanced aerial mobility applications are typically short-range, runway independent, and highly automated vehicles such as the electric powered Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVToL) aircraft. Along with new platforms, there are new developments emerging in other areas including vertiport design, software, sensors, alternative energy generation and storage solutions. Community testbeds and service frameworks (e.g., Aerial Experimentation Research Platform for Advanced Wireless and U-Space framework for safe and secure access to airspace) are being developed for experimentation of advanced aerial mobility applications around the world.

New challenges are predicted in areas including airspace operations, traffic management, vehicle health integrity monitoring, and human-autonomy teaming, to name a few. In parallel, there is a need for identifying efficient strategies for micro-weather modeling and prediction, collision avoidance in close encounters, detection of uncooperative and rogue aircraft, and geofencing and GPS-denied operation strategies among others. Advances are also required in communication, navigation, and surveillance domains. Airborne communication options ranging from LTE and 5G networks to satellite links, as well as direct and over-the-air radio frequency links using either licensed or unlicensed frequency spectrum need to be investigated.

This special issue aims to share the progress and efforts being made by researchers, practitioners, and regulators towards advanced aerial mobility. This call solicits novel concepts that are currently being pursued or transformative ideas envisioned for this emerging area of research. Original submissions that discuss research, development, experimentation, and evaluation strategies that support advanced aerial mobility are encouraged within the following scope or related areas:
- Autonomous air space operations: Flight planning, scheduling, and tracking
- Airborne communications: 5G and beyond-5G cellular, satellite, and radio frequency and other (e.g., optical) communication support for UAS, for both air-ground (AG) and air-air (AA)
- Aerial platforms:  Aerodynamics, power, propulsion, energy efficiency
- Command, control, navigation, and surveillance: Aircraft identification, beyond visual line of sight and beyond radio line of sight communication, and navigation in GPS denied areas
- Remote Identification (ID) support for UAS using low-power wide-area network technologies: Theoretical/simulation results, analysis, and experiments with technologies such as LoRa, Sigfox, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.X and 5.X, NB-IoT, and ASTM standards for remote ID
- Multi-vehicle cooperation: Collision avoidance and conflict management and resolution
- Traffic Management: Geofencing, air corridors, and trajectory design and optimization
- Human-autonomy and teaming: Best practices and strategies for pilots to interact with unmanned systems in the same air space

CALL FOR PAPERS

Special Issue on

DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS  -

JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

WEBSITE:
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future

SCOPE:
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.

To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.

The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.

These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

COMPSAC 2021
INTELLIGENT & RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD
https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/
JULY 12-16, 2021


***CALL FOR PAPERS***

Computers, Software, and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis.  Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication.  Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely.  These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities.  But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered.  Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently.  In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses.  As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported.  How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing.  How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users?  For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!

COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.

***SUBMISSION***

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports.

** Scope and motivation

 

As the number of communication devices and data demands are growing, awareness

of the value of wireless communication gadgets has also tremendously increased.

The need for higher agricultural productivity, industrial automation, clean air

and clean water, convenient and safe city life, surveillance are some aspects

that call for deployment of IoT devices for autonomous monitoring and actuation.

Realization of large-scale deployment hinge upon green and energy-sustainable

operation of the devices. In this framework, the SAGE workshop aims to draw

together researchers and practitioners engaged in the progress and continued

endeavors on such technology solutions. It focuses on the energy sustainability

aspects of IoT and, in general, on machine‐type communications, actuation, and

control automation in smart environments, which is a major theme of 5G+ and 6G

technologies. Beyond theoretical studies, the interest is on technology viability

of green and energy‐sustainable communication solutions ranging from low‐rate

telemetric communications to highly‐reliable, ultra‐low latency, and bandwidth‐

intensive communications.

Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19


PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021

 

Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:


●   Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks

●   AI/ML applied to epidemic data

●   Approaches for resource constrained testing

Dear all,

you are invited to consider publication in the MPDI Sensors Special Issue on "Green Sensors Networking".

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network

Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.

Special Issue Information

Recent improvements in integrated circuit technology have led to the development of new low-cost, tiny sensor nodes. Consequently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being introduced into many different application areas, such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, wearables, transportation, security, surveillance, and other industrial needs. WSNs consist of a large number of self-sustainable, autonomous devices that are able to sense their environment and process and transmit related data. Sensor nodes are commonly hardware-constrained devices that must work under severe resource restrictions such as limited battery, communication, storage, and computing capabilities. In particular, to cope with the scarcity of available energy and to ensure long-term operation, sensor nodes must be designed with low energy radio and sensing units, employ energy efficient communication protocols, and implement optimal energy management policies.
The key for reducing energy consumption in WSNs is the wise utilization of network resources, including power, spectrum, time, and spatial resources. For example, in these networks involving a large number of distributed devices, cooperative power control techniques based on convex optimization or game theory permit governing transmission power efficiently. Furthermore, energy-harvesting technology is frequently used to provide a virtually uninterrupted power supply to the sensor nodes although, due to the intermittent and variable nature of ambient energy sources, accurate prediction schemes of future energy availability may be required to avoid energy shortages.

Energy demands of WSNs can also be reduced, alleviating mutual interference through efficient MAC protocols, employing energy-aware routing algorithms or exploiting available power-saving modes at the sensor nodes. Finally, advanced distributed storage and computation schemes that decrease the number of transmissions and receptions for data collection and dissemination can be adopted to save energy in these networks.

The purpose of this Special Issue is to present the most recent advances, or comprehensive reviews, relating to green wireless sensor networks. Potential topics include but are not limited to:

Energy harvesting;
Distributed power control schemes;
Energy efficient WSN architecture and design;
Energy efficient communication protocols for WSNs;
Green MAC protocols for WSNs;
Green routing algorithms for WSNs;
Green device-to-device communications;
Green computing for sensor nodes;
Energy management policies for sensor nodes;
Energy availability prediction schemes.

journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.

Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.

This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.

***Call for Papers***

Current communication networks are increasingly becoming pervasive, complex, and ever-evolving due to factors like enormous growth in the number of network users, continuous appearance of network applications, increasing amount of data transferred, and diversity of user behaviors. Understanding and measuring traffic in such networks is a difficult yet vital task for network management but recently also for cybersecurity purposes. Network traffic measuring and monitoring can, for example, enable the analysis of the spreading of malicious software and its capabilities or can help to understand the nature of various network threats including those that exploit users’ behavior and other user’s sensitive information. On the other hand network traffic investigation can also help to assess the effectiveness of the existing countermeasures or contribute to building new, better ones. Recently, traffic measurements have been utilized in the area of economics of cybersecurity e.g. to assess ISP "badness" or to estimate the revenue of cybercriminals.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research accomplishments provided by researchers from academia and the industry. The other goal is to show the latest research results in the field of cybersecurity and understand how traffic measurements can influence it. We encourage prospective authors to submit related distinguished research papers on the subject of both: theoretical approaches and practical case reviews. This workshop presents some of the most relevant ongoing research in cybersecurity seen from the traffic measurements perspective. The workshop will be accessible to both non-experts interested in learning about this area and experts interested in hearing about new research and approaches.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

+ Measurements for network incidents response, investigation, and evidence handling
+ Measurements of cyber attacks (e.g. DDoS, botnet, malware, and phishing campaigns)
+ Measurements for security of web-based applications and services (e.g. social networking)
+ Measurements for network anomalies detection
+ Measurements for economics of cybersecurity and privacy
+ Measurements of security and privacy for the Internet of Things
+ Measurements of Internet censorship
+ Measurement studies describing the impacts of regulations on cybersecurity and users' privacy (e.g. GDPR)
+ Network traffic analysis to discover the nature and evolution of the cybersecurity threats
+ Measurements of cyber-physical systems security
+ Measurements for assessing the effectiveness of the threats detection/prevention methods and countermeasures
+ Novel passive, active and hybrid measurements techniques for cybersecurity purposes
+ Traffic classification and topology discovery tools for monitoring the evolving status of the network from the cybersecurity perspective
+ Correlation of measurements across multiple layers, protocols or networks for cybersecurity purposes
+ Machine learning and data mining for analysis of network traffic measurements for cybersecurity
+ Novel approaches for large-scale measurements for cybersecurity (e.g. crowd-sourcing)
+ Novel visualization approaches to detect network attacks and other threats

Elsevier Applied Soft Computing (ASOC) Special Issue on "Application of Computational Intelligence models in Transformative Computing technologies"

https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-soft-computing/call-for-papers/computational-intelligence-models-transformative-computing


------------------------------

Recently a Transformative Computing paradigm has been developed, and define as a new branch of modern computer sciences and information technologies. This new approach allow to join sensor signals and wireless communication technologies, with extensive signal/data analysis using AI technologies. The main idea of this emerging technology, is connection of low level signal acquisition, originating from smart or IoT sensors, with global communication, which allow to transmit and collect required data in secure manner for further semantic analysis or extensive analytical evaluation. Final data analysis should involve application of advanced soft computing or AI approaches. Such connection enhances computing possibilities, by increasing efficiency of data extraction, acquisition, and exploration, as well as performing more sophisticated analysis at different levels starting from sensor networks till augmented cognition. It can also be applicable for solving complex real life problems thanks to the application of computational intelligence approaches, oriented on using of novel methods like cognitive computing, which is based on models of human visual perception. Such human oriented data analysis and information processing approaches allow to deeply analyse a great amount of signals and information sourced from IoT, smart technologies, multimedia, and VR, manage them, and securely transmit over global networks. This Special Issue will be oriented on new possible applications of various computational intelligence methods approaches in transformative computing solutions and technologies.

*** Special Issue on "Contact Tracing" ***

* Guest Editors:
    - Mohamed F. Mokbel, Qatar Computing Research Institute
    - Li Xiong, Emory University
    - Demetrios Zeinalipour-Yazti, University of Cyprus

Contact Tracing refers to the process of tracking persons who may have come
into spatial contact with an infected person, and subsequently collecting
further information about these contacts. The feature-rich interaction,
processing and localization/communication modalities of smartphone devices,
have brought these to battle on the technological forefront and have curbed
the fast spread of pandemics, like COVID-19, introducing the notion of
"digital vaccines" to custodians aiming at fast prevention rather than
slow intervention.

The community has to this date proposed a wide range of approaches, ranging
from: opportunistic to participatory approaches, privacy-sensitive to
no-privacy approaches, handheld-based (distributed) to cloud-based
(centralized) approaches, proximity-based (e.g., BLE, sound) to
location-based approaches (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPS), for only outdoor settings
to indoor settings, using closed-source to open-source counterparts. However,
a wide range of challenges remain unanswered, including methodologies to
improve the penetration and adoption rates, alleviate privacy or expectation
skepticism, ubiquitous availability on low-end terminals as well as
technological/psychological adoption barriers, achieving cross-country
interoperability with standard formations beyond recommendations,
scalability/reliability and accuracy verification of engaged spatial
technologies as well as lessons about effectiveness from real large-scale
deployments.

This special issue intends to bring together transdisciplinary researchers and
practitioners working in topics from multiple areas, e.g., Information
Communication Technologists (geographic information systems, databases,
storage, big data, data mining, machine learning, security/privacy),
Epidemiologists, Medical Practitioners, Psychologists, Emergency Response
and Public safety, among others.

* Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    - Proximity and localization technologies for Contact Tracing
    - Spatial data structures and algorithms for Contact Tracing
    - Open-source Contact Tracing apps
    - Machine learning and mobility prediction for Contact Tracing
    - Geospatial graphical user interfaces for Contact Tracing
    - User behavior characterization in Contact Tracing
    - Contact Tracing architectures and protocols
    - Domain-specific Contact Tracing apps (e.g., factories, campuses,
      hospitals)
    - Location privacy, data sharing and security
    - Contact Tracing large-scale field studies and lessons learnt
    - Accessibility of Contact Tracing apps and systems
    - Ubiquitous Contact Tracing for low-end smartphone device and device
      diversity aspects
    - Individual vs. collective spatial intelligence in Contact Tracing
    - Exposure risk modeling

The journal welcomes articles on any of the above topics or closely related
disciplines in the context of contact tracing. TSAS will encourage original
submissions that have not been published or submitted in any form elsewhere,
and submissions which may significantly contribute to opening up new and
potentially important areas of research and development. TSAS will publish
outstanding papers that are "major value-added extensions" of papers
previously published in conferences. Such extensions should contribute at
least 30% new original work. In this case, authors will need to identify
in a separate document the list of extensions over their previously
published paper. For more information, please visit tsas.acm.org/authors.cfm.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

The technical program committee welcomes paper submissions on all topics related to computer and communication networks. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages, including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS: https://edas.info/N27861. When submitting a paper, its title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The metadata should be provided before the abstract registration deadline. The program committee may ask some authors to shorten their paper to a short paper of 3 pages to be presented in a poster session, instead of a plenary session.

 

Instruction on preparing a paper for double-blind review.

- Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.

- Remove acknowledgments.

- Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search.

- Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.

- Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that ...," sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that ..." should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1] A. Clark …., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."

- The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.

- The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.

- Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.

 

At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library. To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.



-------------------------------------------------------
We love you. We are sorry. Please forgive us. Thank you.

JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON

 

Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19


PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021

 

Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:


●   Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks

●   AI/ML applied to epidemic data

●   Approaches for resource constrained testing

●   Adaptive interventions

●   Contact tracing

●   Mobile sensing for health monitoring

●   Privacy in E-health

●   Technologies to mitigate misinformation around epidemics

●   Other communications and networking approaches relevant for combatting COVID-19

      Embedding Internet of Everything in New-Age Smart Environments
  https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/ioe_smart_enviro
****************************************************************************************

After the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) for scenarios requiring sensor monitoring, the research community has realized that specific environments require narrowing down technological solutions to particular study cases. Examples of these particular scenarios are the recently coined research areas of the Internet of People, Internet of Processes, Internet of Data or Internet of Vehicles, as spin-off fields of the IoT seed. It is understood that future electronics will be inherently connected in what is called the Internet of Everything (IoE), fostering the connectivity of all physical and virtual entities in the Future Internet.

However, the mere collection of sensor records could be useless without a proper treatment of data using, first, an efficient communication medium and, second, a proper infrastructure feeding services and final applications. The evolution from IoT to IoE, and the birth of all other IoX subfields, has lately been coupled with new communication technologies enabling connectivity to battery-powered constrained devices and, even more recently, to moving sensors. Common architectures requiring local communication gateways for Internet connectivity could be inefficient or directly inapplicable when monitoring moving “objects” in open spaces such as cities, maritime areas, agricultural fields or forests.

This Special Issue wants to exploit the momentum on IoE technologies for self-contained electronic devices addressed at current and upcoming smart spaces. For this, researchers are invited to contribute original works as well as review articles in topics covering sensor integration in IoE, low-power wireless communication technologies, sustainable and efficient IoT deployments, moving sensors and crowdsensing, 5G application in IoE and smart scenarios, and network protocols for new IoE scenarios.

Potential topics include but are not limited to:

- Low-power wide area networks for sensor connectivity;
- Mobile sensor networks;
- 5G technologies for massive machine type communications (mMTC);
- Embedded platforms for mobile monitoring;
- Connected wearables for crowdsensing;
- Internet of Vehicles;
- Self-contained sensory platforms for smart environments;
- Network slicing strategies for IoE;
- Internet of Everything platforms;
- Energy efficient IoE devices;
- Sustainable IoE deployments.
