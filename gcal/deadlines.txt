DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS  -

JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

WEBSITE:
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future


IMPOTRANT DATES:

Submission deadline: 31-May-2021
Acceptance deadline: 31-Oct-2021
Publication: late 2021

SCOPE:
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.

To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.

The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.

These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

Aims and Scope

Nowadays, the global vision is the progressive migration towards smart cities in order to enhance the citizen life and to encounter many problems induced by population growth and increased urbanization, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, ... These smart environments can be viewed as interconnection of wide-scale cyber-physical systems, with sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators to collect diverse information from the surrounding environment and with actuators dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. Through such systems, many innovative applications can be proposed in several fields of activity, such as smart living, smart mobility, smart economy, smart environment and smart governance.  As the human factor is involved in many applications, verifying and proving the validity and correctness of protocols and applications are crucial steps before deployment, in addition to ensuring other paradigms such as scalability, energy saving, resource constraints, etc. In this context, several methods and approaches of Distributed Computing are exploited in software and hardware to propose new approaches able to support and analyse the huge amount of collected information and to deal with the control of these emerging networks.

Special Issue on "Special Issue on Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods"

                                    MDPI IoT Journal



Dear Colleagues,

The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).

Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.

For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)

Special Issue Website: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI

This special issue is now open for submission, until 30 June 2021.

---deadline--- 210630 (mdpi)cloud-based-IoT-apps.smartcities

s Guest Editors, we cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue "Cloud-Based IoT Applications for Smart Cities" to be published in the journal Smart Cities (ISSN 2624-6511) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities/).  
 
The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement. 
Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy. 
The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT.

---deadline--- 210514 ACM.peoplecentric.operations

Hi Everyone,

We are extremely excited to announce the 1st Workshop on People-centric Operations, to be held virtually in conjunction with ACM EC, on July 23, 2021! 

The workshop aims to address research questions arising from social systems whose operations critically rely on the participation of a large number of individuals. Examples include modern online platforms, decentralized energy markets, cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers, etc. Whether intermediated by a centralized entity or wholly decentralized, the operations of these systems are complicated by the underlying complex network structures, the challenges of large-scale alignment of incentives, and of learning from data. Moreover, the decentralized and people-centric nature of processes on these platforms entails working with “indirect” operational levers such as recommendations, signaling, information design, and user interface design. They further pose additional constraints pertaining to fairness and ethics. This workshop will bring together researchers from across operations management, computer science, and economics to explore new challenges and research directions in such crowd-based systems.

Potential areas include:
Operations with crowds and volunteers

Distributed ledgers and payment systems
Decentralized energy markets and cloud energy storage
Crowdfunding and micro-investing
Decentralized decision-making and crowdsourced democracy
Operational challenges in sharing economy and online labor platforms
Achieving operational goals through information design, recommendations, and other new levers


Authors of papers accepted to the main program will be invited to present their work at the workshop. The workshop will also host a poster session and the authors can indicate whether they would like their paper to be considered for the poster session. 

Important Information:
Paper Submission Deadline: 14 May 2021 

Paper Submission Page: Easychair
Notification: 21 June 2021
Event Date: July 23, 2021


Submission Requirements

Papers should be submitted on Easychair. There are no formatting requirements or page limits, but we will instruct reviewers that they do not have to read past the first 8 pages. Please ensure that relevance to the workshop theme, scientific merit, and any potential for impact are evident in the first 8 pages. Submitted pdfs should be fully anonymized.

Call for Papers Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Vehicular Communication Networks - IEEE VT Magazine (Impact Factor: 7.921)
http://ieeevtc.org/vtmagazine/specisu--AI-AVCNet.php
**********************************************************************************

With the advancement of sensing, communications and networking, autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a vital role in a variety of areas, including healthcare, industry 4.0, smart farming and agriculture, logistics, transportation, and public safety. Together with the upcoming B5G/6G technologies, connected vehicular systems will become more ubiquitous and practical. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques can provide significant benefits towards automating the tasks of sensing, computing, and communicating in vehicular communication networks.

To achieve real-time perception and autonomous control, computing and communications in AI-enabled vehicular communication networks will be more complex and heterogeneous than before. Security and privacy will be extremely challenging, due to certain characteristics of these complex systems (high mobility of nodes and unreliable link connectivity) combined with vulnerable end devices, limited resources, and heterogeneous networking. For example, data collected from sensors for AI-based approaches pose new security threats. ML models trained at edge devices may suffer from various malicious attacks, but distributed ML algorithms are essential in vehicular communication networks with multiple self-organizing vehicles for control that is both scalable and low-latency.

The objective of this special issue is to bring together state-of-the-art innovations and research activities (from both academia and industry) to explore AI-based autonomous vehicular communication network technologies. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Edge learning in autonomous vehicular communication networks
- Deep learning and distributed machine learning for vehicular communication networks
- AI techniques for radio environment awareness in vehicular networks
- Reinforcement learning for network decision making, network control, and management
- Reinforcement learning for self-organized vehicular communication networks
- Predictive QoS in autonomous vehicular communication networks
- Privacy-preserving machine learning for autonomous vehicular communication networks
- Blockchain-enabled autonomous vehicular communication networks
- Joint design of AI-based communication and sensing in vehicular communication networks
- AI-driven energy-efficient architectures/solutions for autonomous vehicular communication networks
- Fault detection and self-healing in vehicular communication networks
- New AI-based intelligent transportation systems and services in vehicular communication networks

Description
In recent years, machine learning techniques (e.g., support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, etc.) and deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), etc.) have been popularly applied into image recognition and time-series inferences for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). For instance, advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous cars have been developed based on machine learning and deep learning techniques to perform forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning systems, traffic sign recognition, traffic safety, infrastructure management and congestion, and so on. Autonomous cars can share their detected information (e.g., traffic signs, collision events, etc.) with other cars via vehicular communication systems (e.g., dedicated short range communication (DSRC), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), long-term evolution (LTE), and the 5th generation mobile networks) for cooperation. However, the performance and efficiency of these techniques are big challenges for performing real-time applications.

Therefore, several optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent algorithm, Adam optimization algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, etc.) have been proposed to support deep learning algorithms in finding faster solutions. For example, the gradient descent method is a popular optimization technique to quickly seek the optimized weight sets and filters of CNN for image recognition. The ITS applications based on these image recognition techniques (e.g., autonomous cars, augmented reality navigation systems, etc.) have gained more attention, and the hybrid approaches typical of mathematics for engineering and computer science (e.g. machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques) can be investigated and developed to support a variety of ITS applications.

The aim of this Special Issue is to focus on both original research and review articles on various disciplines of ITS applications, particularly machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for ITS time-series data analyses, ITS spatiotemporal data analyses, advanced traffic management systems, advanced traveler information systems, commercial vehicle operation systems, advanced vehicle control and safety systems, advanced public transportation services, emergency management services, electronic payment services, advanced information management services, information management services, vulnerable individual protection services, and other ITS applications.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for ITS time-series and spatiotemporal data analyses
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for advanced traffic management and safety, traveler information, commercial vehicle operation, advanced vehicle control and safety, and advanced public transportation systems
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for emergency management, electronic payment, advanced information management, and vulnerable individual protection services
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for image recognition
Applications and techniques for image recognition based on machine learning and deep learning for ITS
Applications and techniques for autonomous cars and ships based on machine learning and deep learning
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for quality of service in VANET
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for infrastructure management and congestion



---deadline--- 210615 (mdpi)security.for.vnets

Dear Colleagues, 
As Guest Editor, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue "Security Measures in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks" to be published in the journal Electronics (IF 2.412) (ISSN 2079-9292) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/).  
 
The Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is a self-organised ad-hoc network that can be formed by connecting vehicles with other vehicles on the road and with static infrastructure such as crossroads or parking lots. VANET allows its users to share their information and knowledge about road conditions, events, and traffic. Analysing data from this type of network allows road safety to be increased efficiently by controlling crises on the road and supports traffic management thanks to Internet access for drivers and software developers. 
However, just like any network, VANET is exposed to attacks and attempts to gain access to data that are generated and transferred between network elements. 
Therefore, it has become necessary to design, develop, and extend the appropriate security methods, mechanisms and tools for VANET to protect and secure data exchanged between the network nodes, and, consequently, to secure its users and protect them against incorrect information, misinformation, and delays in information sending.  
This Special Issue aims to present a collection of papers that address problems in the methods, mechanisms, and tools for securing the VANETs and their users by exploring aspects such as security design, architectures, deployment, routing, and protocols.  
Topics of interest include but not are limited to security methods and mechanics for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication environments, protective methods against any form of security attack (e.g., DoS attack, timing attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Bogus, Sybil, Black, Worm and Gray Hole attack), the security of routing protocols, security and privacy methods for availability, confidentiality, data integration, authentication, and access control.

The manuscript submission deadline is 31 August 2021. We will process your paper in time once we receive your submission. For more details please visit the Special Issue website:  

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/security_measures

Special Issue on

Federated Learning and Blockchain Supported Smart Networking in Beyond 5G (B5G) Wireless Communication

https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-networks/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-federated-learning-and-blockchain

Computer Networks

NOTE: we are particularly looking for submissions that tackle the applications of FL and/or BC in the B5G setup, smart networking, or wireless communications.

Please note that the deadline has been extended till May 20th!
In recent years, Blockchain and Federated Learning (FL) are both making great technological advances independently. Blockchain provides a distributed and secure decentralized technique to process and authenticate transactions. On the other hand, FL enables end-devices to collaboratively train and update a mutual machine learning model while preserving the privacy of their data-sets. Both technologies are known to have several desirable advantages for today's needs in terms of security and privacy. Moreover, when blockchain and FL technologies are enabled in B5G and 6G, security and privacy are preserved with full connectivity and distributivity. As both blockchain and FL advance further, the research focus is turning to integrate and unify the technologies to produce novel and smart networking services and applications. Currently, for large-scale advanced services and applications, the proposed solutions are far from practical. There are still many unresolved technical challenges in having systems that are scalable, and robust, and able to handle exponentially growing data.

Both blockchain and FL, supported by next-generation networking (NGN) technologies, including Beyond 5G and 6G, have the potential to address smart networking services and applications’ shortcomings by providing power computing processing and handling massive volumes of generated data. The benefits of synergizing these two technologies with NGN will without doubt provide a revolutionized approach towards widespread smart networking services and applications. Smart healthcare, Internet of Things, intelligent and industrial automation (industry 4.0), cyber-physical sensory systems, and smart and critical infrastructures, energy trading, smart shopping, smart banking, and efficient manufacturing procedures are examples of use cases that may receive impressive benefits from integrating these technologies. As such, this special issue aims to explore recent advances and disseminate state-of-the-art research on blockchain-based solutions and  FL services and applications focused on Computer Networking issues.

Topics of Interest

Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the followings topics or slightly similar ones:

●       Integration of Blockchain and FL in Beyond 5G/6G Network Architectures

●       FL for large-scale Internet of Things

IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing (TETC) seeks submissions for the upcoming special section on “To Be Safe and Dependable in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: Emerging Techniques for Trusted and Reliable Machine Learning”. 
 
During the last decade, advances in areas such as convolutional neural networks, deep learning, and hardware accelerators have enabled the widespread and ubiquitous adoption of machine learning (ML) in real-world systems. This trend is expected to continue and expand in the coming years, leading to a world that depends heavily on ML-based systems.
 
To be safe and dependable in this new era of artificial intelligence, these innovative systems have to be reliable and secure. This poses many research challenges. For example, fault tolerance is commonly achieved by redundant design, but the implementation of deep neural networks is already challenging, so there is little room to add additional elements for fault tolerance. Similarly, understanding the vulnerabilities of advanced ML systems is a complex issue, as shown by recent attacks on image classification implementations. Therefore, it is essential to learn how to build ML systems that cannot be manipulated or corrupted by malicious attackers and that can operate reliably when its underlying hardware or software suffers from errors.
 
This special section is devoted to: 1) recent advances in techniques, algorithms, and implementations for error-tolerant ML systems and 2) trust/reliable aspects of ML systems and algorithms, including vulnerabilities, management, protection, and mitigation schemes. Original papers with substantial technical contribution are solicited on the following topics:

Design and analysis of trusted/reliable ML algorithms and systems
Innovative computational paradigms for ML, such as approximate/stochastic computing
Fault/error-tolerant ML systems and techniques
Trust, dependability, reliability, and security in ML implementations
Adversarial and related techniques for ML systems and algorithms
Techniques for trustworthy ML inclusive of detection, mitigation, and defense
Evaluation of ML for applications such as in safety-critical and secure systems
 
Schedule
Deadline for submissions: October 15, 2021
First decision (accept/reject/revise, tentative): January 15, 2022
Submission of revised papers: March 15, 2022
Notification of final decision (tentative): May 1, 2022
Journal publication (tentative): second half of 2022

Submission Guidelines
Submitted papers must include new significant research-based technical contributions in the scope of the journal. Purely theoretical, technological, or lacking methodological-and-generality papers are not suitable for this special section. The submissions must include clear evaluations of the proposed solutions (based on simulation and/or implementation results) and comparison to state-of-the-art solutions. Papers under review elsewhere are not acceptable for submission. Extended versions of published conference papers (to be included as part of the submission together with a summary of differences) are welcome but there must have at least 40% of new impacting technical/scientific material in the submitted journal version, and there should be less than 50% verbatim similarity level as reported by a tool (such as CrossRef). Guidelines concerning the submission process, LaTeX, and Word templates can be found on the Author Information page. While submitting through ScholarOne, please select this special-section option. As per TETC policies, only full-length papers (10-16 pages with technical material, double column – papers beyond 12 pages will be subject to MOPC, as per CS policies -) can be submitted to special sections. The bibliography should not exceed 45 items and each author’s bio should not exceed 150 words.

Call for papers
This Issue is now open for submissions.

Papers are published upon acceptance, regardless of the Special Issue publication date.

Description
In recent years, supervised machine learning methods (e.g. k nearest neighbours, Bayes' theorem, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network, gated recurrent unit network), unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g. association rules, k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, hierarchical clustering, deep belief networks, deep Boltzmann machine, auto-encoder, de-noising auto-encoder, etc.), reinforcement learning methods (e.g. generative adversarial network, deep Q network, trust region policy optimization, etc.), and federated learning methods have been applied to security and communication networks. For instance, machine learning methods have been used to analyze the behaviours of the data stream in networks and extract the patterns of malicious activities (packet dropping, worm propagation, jammer attacks, etc.) for generating rules in intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, time-series methods (e.g. local outlier factor, cumulative sum, adaptive online thresholding, etc.) have been proposed to retrieve the time-series features of anomalous behaviours for preventing cyber-attacks and malfunctions.

While the area of machine learning methods for security and communication networks is a rapidly expanding field of scientific research, several open research questions still need to be discussed and studied. For instance, using and improving machine learning methods for malicious activity detection, attack detection, mobile endpoint analyses, repetitive security task automation, zero-day vulnerability prevention, and other security applications are important issues in computing and communications.

This Special Issue will solicit papers across various disciplines of security and communication networks in computing and communications. Original research and review articles are welcome.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

New supervised machine learning methods for security and communication networks
New unsupervised machine learning methods for security and communication networks
New reinforcement learning methods for security and communication networks
New federated learning methods for security and communication networks
New optimization methods for security and communication networks

First International Workshop on
Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures in the IoT Era (EAIoT’2021)
http://eaiot2021.connect.rs
In conjunction with IEEE EDOC’21
http://ieee-edoc.org/2021/
Gold Coast, Australia, October 25, 2021

CALL FOR PAPERS
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all 
perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and 
competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and 
non-functional practices. According to the International Data 
Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion 
within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT 
devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the 
Internet by 2023.

  To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design 
principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures 
are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into 
these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business, 
information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these 
foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open 
forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about 
the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of 
enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the 
lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to 
integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and 
deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a 
new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only 
a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources 
inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis, 
knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better 
understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new 
ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the 
competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) trend.

Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that 
enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could 
undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these 
obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise 
architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT 
devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and 
privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational 
capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT 
in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.



Topics of Interest
This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both 
disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise 
architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could 
capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of 
business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT. 
Topics for discussions include, but are not limited to:
* Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0.
* Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture
* Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
* Context management and awareness for IoT-based enterprise architecture
* Case studies related to IoT-based enterprise architecture.

Deep Learning for Internet of Things
CFP:  https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/open-special-sections/deep-learning-for-internet-of-things/



Submission Deadline:  30 November 2021

IEEE Access invites manuscript submissions in the area of Deep Learning for Internet of Things.   

In recent years, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to detect and collect human and environment information (e.g. geo-information, weather information, bio-information, human behaviors, etc.) for a variety of intelligent services and applications. The three layers in IoT are the sensor, networking, and application layers; several techniques and standards (e.g. oneM2M, Open Connectivity Foundation, etc.) have been proposed and established for these three layers. For the sensor and networking layers, the rise of mobile technology advancements (e.g. wireless sensor networks, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, narrow band-IoT, etc.) has led to a new wave of machine-to-machine (M2M), machine-to-human (M2H), human-to-human (H2H), and human-to-machine (H2M) communications. For the application layer, the IoT techniques in several applications, including energy, enterprise, healthcare, public services, residency, retail, and transportation, have been designed and implemented to detect environmental changes and send instant updates to a cloud computing server farm via mobile communications and middleware for big data analyses. One of the perfect examples is that the vehicle on-board units can instantly detect and share information about the vehicle geolocation, speed, following distance, as well as gaps with other neighboring vehicles. Big data can be collected by IoT techniques and then analyzed by deep learning techniques for a variety of applications and services.

Deep learning techniques, e.g. neural network (NN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc., have been popularly applied into image recognition and time-series inference for IoT applications. Advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous cars, for instance, have been developed based on machine learning and deep learning techniques, which perform forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, traffic safety, infrastructure management and congestion, and so on. Autonomous cars can share their detected information, such as traffic signs, collision events, etc., with other cars via vehicular communication systems, e.g., dedicated short range communications (DSRC), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), long term evolution (LTE), and 5th generation mobile networks for cooperation. However, how to enhance the performance and efficiency of these deep learning techniques is one of the big challenges for implementing these real-time applications.

Furthermore, several optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), adaptive moment estimation algorithm (Adam), and Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam), have been proposed to support deep learning algorithms for faster solution searching; for example, the gradient descent method is a popular optimization technique to quickly seek the optimized weight sets and filters of CNN for image recognition. The IoT applications based on these image recognition techniques (autonomous cars, augmented reality navigation systems, etc.) have gained considerable attention, and the hybrid approaches typical of mathematics for engineering and computer science (deep learning and optimization techniques) can be investigated and developed to support a variety of IoT applications.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Deep learning for massive IoT
Deep learning for critical IoT
Deep learning for enhancing IoT security
Deep learning for enhancing IoT privacy
Preprocessing of IoT data for AI modeling
Deep learning for IoT applications (smart home, smart agriculture, interactive art, etc.)

Scope

**********************

Wireless ad hoc, sensor, along with ubiquitous networks have recently witnessed their fastest growth period ever in history, and this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. However, as such networks become increasingly complex, performance modelling and evaluation will play a crucial part in their design process to ensure their successful deployment and exploitation in practice.

This symposium will bring together scientists, engineers, and practitioners to share and exchange their experiences, discuss challenges, and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on all aspects of wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks with a specific emphasis on their performance evaluation and analysis.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

· Predictive performance models of ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks.

· Probabilistic models for ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks.

· Queuing and network information theoretic analysis

· Analytical modeling and simulation methods

· Automatic performance analysis

· Tracing and trace analysis

· Software tools for network performance and evaluation

· Performance measurement, evaluation and monitoring tools for ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks

· Case studies demonstrating the role of performance evaluation in the design of ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks

· Network performance improvement through optimization and tuning

· Mobility modeling and management

· Traffic models for ad hoc, sensor networks

· Performance evaluation of wireless mesh networks

· Performance evaluation of pervasive and ubiquitous networks

· Performance evaluation of VANETs

· Performance of wireless and sensor devices

· Performance of spectrum agile and cognitive wireless sensor networks

· Analysis of multimedia applications over wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks

· Performance of pervasive computing and services

· Analysis of mobile cloud networking and computing

· Performance of continuity of service over heterogeneous networks, seamless connectivity

· Analysis of security and privacy in ad hoc networks and ubiquitous networks

· Simulation methods, performance and analysis

· Real experimentation, deployments, open platforms
