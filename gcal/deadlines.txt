CALL FOR PAPERS 
CVNET 2020: The First International Workshop on Cooperative Vehicular NETworking 
 November 17th, 2020
https://sites.google.com/usmba.ac.ma/cvnet2020

To be held in conjunction with
 EAI ADHOCNETS 2020 - 12th EAI International Conference on Ad Hoc Networks
November 17-18, 2020
https://adhocnets.eai-conferences.org/2020/
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

About the Workshop:
Cooperative vehicular networking is widely acknowledged as a key enabler of the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), known as Cooperative-ITS. The range of application of C-ITS is very large, including driving assistance - cooperative awareness, cooperative intersection management, cooperative platoon control, etc. Thanks to V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) communication technology, all ITS actors (vehicles, infrastructure and other road users) can cooperatively exchange real time information, leading to increasing levels of safety and efficiency. The V2X technology combines different communication technologies, from short and medium range ad-hoc direct communication to 3G/4G (future 5G) cellular network communication to realize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-person (V2P) network connections. Developing C-ITS applications has to cope with many challenges, related to control theory and signal processing as well as wireless communication. C-ITS applications impose different requirements in terms of latency, throughput, reliability on the network and safety of the V2X environment.

The CVNET workshop intends to cover all aspects of vehicular communication technologies and cooperative V2X systems. It aims to bring together engineers and scientists from both academia and industry to exchange ideas and foster discussion about the main challenges facing the deployment of C-ITS. The topics are not only limited to vehicular networks but also include applications of intelligent transportation systems, safety systems, connected vehicles and telematics.

Workshop Topics:
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
Cooperative V2X communication
Routing and protocols for cooperative V2X systems
Big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence technologies for V2X
Vehicular networks and systems management
Cross-layer design and optimization for vehicular networks
Security and privacy issues in vehicular communication environment
Vehicular data mining
Architectures, algorithms and protocols design for data dissemination, processing, and aggregation in vehicular networks
Heterogenous vehicular networks (ITS-G5, 3G/4G/5G,...)
Vehicular data services
Safety and non-safety automotive applications

Submission guidelines:
We solicit both theoretical and technical papers describing original and unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference. Accepted papers will be published in proceedings of the EAI ADHOCNETS, and will be submitted for publishing by Springer and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library.

Because of COVID-19, we have decided to reschedule the conference on Dec 1-3 as a FULLY VIRTUAL event.

Internet has revolutionized the globalized society and enabled the growth of infrastructures, applications, and technologies that significantly enhance global interactions and collaborations that have significant impact on society. Unprecedented cyber-social, and cyber-physical infrastructures and systems that span geographic boundaries are possible because of the Internet and the growing number of collaborations enabling technologies. Individuals and organizations have increasingly relied on electronic and/or Internet-enabled collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce collaboratively developed products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators.

Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general purpose tools to specialized collaboration platforms. Future collaboration and Internet computing solutions that further the goal of achieving the full potential of global level collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction, cooperation and collaboration paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools.

IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (IEEE CIC) has been conceived as the key multidisciplinary venue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in Internet technologies, applications and services, collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.

                         Network Softwarization and Management Series


=====================================================================================

This series focuses on softwarization, management, and their integration in communication networks and
their services. “Network softwarization” advocates for architectures that separate the software implementing
network functions, protocols and services from the hardware running them. Propelled by the maturity of
technologies like network function virtualization and software-defined networking, softwarization is radically
changing the way communication infrastructures are designed and operated enabling rapid and innovative
service creation. “Network management“ is about administering networks and supporting their operations.
It aims to integrate fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security management in the network;
to leverage the self-management, automation and autonomic capabilities of networks, and to move from a
“managed object” paradigm to a “management by objective” one.

The key role that software and management are increasingly playing in telecommunications is enabling
unprecedented levels of abstraction, disaggregation, operation, integration, and programmability in
network infrastructures and services. This Series publishes in-depth, cutting-edge, articles on state-
of-the-art technologies and solutions bringing together the latest advances, innovations, open-source
projects, case studies, research, and development in Network Softwarization and Management.

IEEE TNSM SPECIAL ISSUE ON LATEST DEVELOPMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF NETWORKS AND SERVICES
https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp

-----------------------------------

Submission Deadline: October 15, 2020

Dear Colleagues:

We cordially invite you to share your latest research results by submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management Special Issue on "Latest Developments for Security Management of Networks and Services".

------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
------------------------

As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.

These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.

IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services. We welcome submissions addressing the important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!

Aims and Scope

Social network (SN) is a social structure and it is the combination of networks and graph theory. A SN contains two major parameters, viz. nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the edges, ties or links (interactions  or relationships) that connect nodes. In SNs, social structures are visualized, e.g. friendship and acquaintance networks, social media networks, business networks, information circulation, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, disease transmission,  collaboration graphs, kinship, sexual relationships, etc. These networks are sometimes visualized using sociograms  where nodes are represented by points and edges are represented by lines. Now-a-days a huge amount of people are using SN throughout the globe and hence social network analysis becomes an important issue and it is a key technique in modern sociology. The mobile and Internet technologies have been the primary force behind the rise of social media, providing technological platforms for information dissemination,  interactive communications, content generation etc.

Analysis of SN is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines, e.g.   data aggregation and mining, network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, social sharing and filtering, recommender systems development, and link prediction and entity resolution, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, information system development analysis, marketing, and business intelligence needs,  development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use,  community-based problem solving and many more.

Today, consumers constantly interact with social media. Companies are very eager to take advantage of our constant engagement with platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. As a result, a growing number are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in social media to better connect with potential customers. Just a single click can impact what notifications pop up on our social media accounts, viz. posts, advertisements, friend suggestions, and more due to the use of AI.

 

This special issue focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to develop and manage SN. The aim of this special issue is provide a forum in which to publish state-of-the-art articles for development, security, management, etc. of SN.

Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19



Brief description/Scope



COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).

Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods based COVID-19 diagnostic systems
Novel AI and Data Science Techniques for lung and infection segmentation
Accurate prediction of COVID-19 based on advanced Pioneering AI and Data Science methods
Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods for tracking and detecting COVID-19

MDPI Sensors - Special Issue

Bluetooth Low Energy: Advances and Applications
https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BLE

Call for Papers

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was first specified in 2010. Since then, its
popularity has not ceased to increase. In fact, BLE has become the
dominant low-power wireless technology in a variety of consumer
electronics devices, including the smartphone. The latter is crucially
important, as it brings widespread presence to BLE. This feature of BLE,
along with its suitability for simple, energy-constrained devices (e.g.,
battery-enabled sensors), allows positioning BLE as a fundamental enabler
of networking paradigms such as wireless sensor networks and the Internet
of Things.

BLE technology and BLE-based networking have also expanded in parallel to
their success. The panoply of BLE features, options, and mechanisms has
significantly increased in the last few years. Significant additions to
the BLE universe include several Bluetooth specification updates (the
latest being Bluetooth 5.2), IPv6 support for BLE devices,
and many initiatives for enabling BLE mesh networks.

BLE applications can be found in a wide range of domains, e.g., smart
home, smart cities, smart health, smart agriculture, or Industry 4.0. BLE
is enabling the interaction between humans and smart objects, as well as
between smart objects themselves. BLE has also been leveraged for
innovative location-based applications, opportunistic data collection,
crowd-sensing, etc.

Remarkably, BLE is also playing a fundamental role in the context of
combatting COVID-19. BLE-enabled sensors are being used in hospitals to
remotely collect vital parameter readings (e.g. temperature, blood
pressure, etc.), minimizing the risk of infection for medical personnel.
Furthermore, the widespread presence of BLE in smartphones is crucial to
enable contact tracing applications being developed and used worldwide.

This Special Issue aims at collecting high quality research papers and
review articles focusing on recent advances in BLE. Original, high-quality
contributions that have not been published before and are not currently
under review by other journals or conferences are sought.

Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Performance evaluation (e.g., mathematical analysis, simulation and/or
  experimentation) of BLE networks.
- BLE version-oriented studies (Bluetooth 4.x, Bluetooth 5.x).
- Internet connectivity of BLE devices: 6LoWPAN/6Lo, gateway-based
  approaches, etc.
- BLE mesh networking standardization efforts: Bluetooth Mesh (Bluetooth
  SIG), IPv6 mesh over BLE (IETF), etc.
- Novel approaches to BLE mesh networks.
- Coexistence of BLE with other wireless technologies.
- BLE beacons.
- BLE-based localization.
- BLE-based opportunistic sensor data collection.
- Innovative applications of BLE in smart home, smart cities, smart
  transportation, smart agriculture, smart health, Industry 4.0, etc.
- Applications of BLE for combatting COVID-19: parameter monitoring, contact
  tracing, etc.

Manuscript submission instructions, and details on Article Processing
Charges (APCs), can be found at:
https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BLE

Submission Deadline:     15 October 2020

Papers are published upon acceptance, regardless of the Special Issue
publication date.

The most recent Journal Citation Reports Impact Factor released for MDPI
Sensors is 3.275 (Q1 in the category of ‘Instruments & Instrumentation’).
