Scope:
======

In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new
path rearrangements.

This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.


The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:

Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;
Complex systems and networks;
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;
Simulation of mobile network structures;
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

Dear all,

you are invited to consider publication in the MPDI Sensors Special Issue on "Green Sensors Networking".

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network

Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.

Special Issue Information

Recent improvements in integrated circuit technology have led to the development of new low-cost, tiny sensor nodes. Consequently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being introduced into many different application areas, such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, wearables, transportation, security, surveillance, and other industrial needs. WSNs consist of a large number of self-sustainable, autonomous devices that are able to sense their environment and process and transmit related data. Sensor nodes are commonly hardware-constrained devices that must work under severe resource restrictions such as limited battery, communication, storage, and computing capabilities. In particular, to cope with the scarcity of available energy and to ensure long-term operation, sensor nodes must be designed with low energy radio and sensing units, employ energy efficient communication protocols, and implement optimal energy management policies.
The key for reducing energy consumption in WSNs is the wise utilization of network resources, including power, spectrum, time, and spatial resources. For example, in these networks involving a large number of distributed devices, cooperative power control techniques based on convex optimization or game theory permit governing transmission power efficiently. Furthermore, energy-harvesting technology is frequently used to provide a virtually uninterrupted power supply to the sensor nodes although, due to the intermittent and variable nature of ambient energy sources, accurate prediction schemes of future energy availability may be required to avoid energy shortages.

Energy demands of WSNs can also be reduced, alleviating mutual interference through efficient MAC protocols, employing energy-aware routing algorithms or exploiting available power-saving modes at the sensor nodes. Finally, advanced distributed storage and computation schemes that decrease the number of transmissions and receptions for data collection and dissemination can be adopted to save energy in these networks.

The purpose of this Special Issue is to present the most recent advances, or comprehensive reviews, relating to green wireless sensor networks. Potential topics include but are not limited to:

Energy harvesting;
Distributed power control schemes;
Energy efficient WSN architecture and design;
Energy efficient communication protocols for WSNs;
Green MAC protocols for WSNs;
Green routing algorithms for WSNs;
Green device-to-device communications;
Green computing for sensor nodes;
Energy management policies for sensor nodes;
Energy availability prediction schemes.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

The technical program committee welcomes paper submissions on all topics related to computer and communication networks. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages, including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS: https://edas.info/N27861. When submitting a paper, its title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The metadata should be provided before the abstract registration deadline. The program committee may ask some authors to shorten their paper to a short paper of 3 pages to be presented in a poster session, instead of a plenary session.

 

Instruction on preparing a paper for double-blind review.

- Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.

- Remove acknowledgments.

- Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search.

- Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.

- Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that ...," sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that ..." should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1] A. Clark …., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."

- The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.

- The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.

- Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.
 
At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.

Special Issue on "Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods"

                                    MDPI IoT Journal



Dear Colleagues,

The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).

Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.

For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)

                    for indoor positioning and navigation”

   https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/


Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust
and seamless positioning  technologies. While mature GNSS  solutions exist for
outdoor spaces,  more than ten  years of  research and development  of sensing
technologies  have not  yet led  to a  widely available  offer of  generic and
affordable standard  solutions for indoors.  Nonetheless, year after  year the
insight that  researchers have  offered into  indoor localization  provides us
with more  methods and the array  of usable sensors widens  with technological
progress. Hybridization of sensors data,  smart capture of environmental data,
benchmarking of sensing  and positioning technologies are all at  the heart of
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.

This Special Issue of the IEEE  Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation
of innovations and  improvements in the field of advanced  sensors and sensing
technologies for  indoor positioning and navigation  including theory, design,
modelling,  configuration,  characterization,  sensor  data  processing,  data
analysis, and applications.

Original  research  contributions  and  review  papers  are  sought  in  areas
including:

• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:
  AoA, TOF,  TDOA based localisation,  RSSI and magnetic  fingerprinting, PDR,
  IMU  and hybrid  systems,  UWB, ultrasound,  optical  systems, RFID,  radar,
  device-free systems, mapping, SLAM
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation
• Sensors for  seamless systems: HS-GNSS,  indoor GNSS, pseudolites,  RTK GNSS
  with  handheld devices,  mitigating  GNSS error  when  switching to  indoor,
  industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion
• Sensing for location-based services and applications
• Sensors benchmarking, assessment, evaluation, standards


Solicited and invited  papers shall undergo the standard  IEEE Sensors Journal
peer-review process. All  manuscripts must be submitted on-line,  via the IEEE

===============================  Overview ======================================
Call for Papers 

The 17th IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management (IM 
2021) will be held on May 17-21, 2021, in Bordeaux, France. Held in odd-numbered 
years since 1989, IM 2021 follows the 33 years tradition of NOMS and IM as the 
primary IEEE Communications Societyís forum for technical exchange on management 
of information and communication technology focusing on research, development, 
integration, standards, service provisioning, and user communities. IM 2021 will 
focus on the theme of "Intelligent Management of Open and Highly Programmable 
Networks". 

It aims to capture recent results, emerging approaches and technical 
solutions for dealing with resilience and sustainability of network and service 
management in highly dynamic environments. Furthermore, the sudden and important 
uptake of work-from-home and the promise of the post-digital era are rising new 
challenges and exacerbating the dynamic nature of the communication 
infrastructure, pushing additional requirements on networks in terms of quality, 
resilience and sustainability. This is also accelerating the adoption of 
Artificial Intelligence advances along with the openness and programmability of 
network infrastructures, to make these more flexible and adaptive. In addition 
to this theme, IM 2021 will cover a wide range of topics of interest within the 
field in integrated network and service management. 

IM 2021 will offer five types of sessions: technical, experience, poster, panel 
and dissertation. High quality will be assured through a well-qualified 
Technical Program Committee and stringent peer review of paper submissions. A 
special call for demonstrations is organized to allow industry partners and 
researchers to demonstrate early products and prototypes.

Journal of Grid Computing - From Grids to Cloud Federations [IF 3.288 (2018)]

Special Issue on Orchestration of computing resources in the Cloud-to-Things continuum
**************************************************************************************************
https://www.springer.com/journal/10723/updates/18017998

Aim and Scope:
The objective of the SI is to collect the latest research findings on major and emerging topics related to the orchestration of resources in a wide ecosystem where IoT, Edge/Fog and Cloud converge to form a computing continuum also known as Cloud-to-Things continuum.
Cloud computing can provide flexible and scalable resources to meet any computing needs. Big Data has revolutionized the approach to data computation. With the increase of the volume of data produced by IoT devices, there is a growing demand of applications capable of elaborating such data flows close to their sources, not just on the Cloud, or anywhere else along the IoT-to- Cloud path (Edge/Fog). Where computation should occur depends on the specific needs of each application. Strict real-time constraints require computation to run as close to the data origin as possible (e.g., IoT Gateway). Conversely, batch-wise tasks (e.g., Big Data analytics) are advised to run on the Cloud where computing resources are abundant. Edge/Fog may be a good compromise in case of a concomitant demand of both computing power and timeliness of elaboration. Application designers would greatly benefit from a support for a flexible and dynamic provisioning of computing resources along the Cloud-to-Things path, that is, a provisioning system capable of orchestrating (activating, deactivating, integrating, etc.) computing resources provided by heterogeneous computing infrastructures. Furthermore, that system shall also take into account and cope with the heterogeneity of providers owning the computing infrastructures in terms of service APIs, guaranteed service levels, data management policies, etc. Moreover, typical data-intensive workloads that consist of data-analytics tasks such as Machine Learning (ML)/AI and descriptive analysis are perfect candidates for the Cloud-to-things continuum, since data is being generated typically on the edge (by IoT devices, etc) with the use for instance of a serverless pipeline, whereas the analysis (either for model training, or execution of descriptive tasks) traditionally happens on centralized locations on the cloud with the use of distributed processing frameworks.
This SI encourages submissions that address resource orchestration issues in the Cloud-to-Things landscape and propose experimental solutions, case studies, deployed systems and best practices in that field.

Topics of the SI include (but are not limited to):
- Resource provisioning and monitoring in Cloud-to-Things environments; Cross cloud/edge service migration; Orchestration of microservices; Blockchain techniques for resource orchestration; Machine learning techniques for resource orchestration;
- Data governance across multiple computing domains; Scheduling and provisioning data analytics on hybrid Edge/Fog and Cloud infrastructures; Stream data processing in Edge/Fog and Clouds; Serverless Execution of Machine Learning and SQL workloads on the Cloud;
- Quality of Service and SLA in Cloud-to-Things environments; Fault management and recovery strategies; Identity and access management; Cross-Infrastructure security mechanisms; Data security and protection;
- Multi-cloud deployment and orchestration; Multi-cloud resource elasticity; Optimisation of services and service chains for Cloud-to-Things systems; Optimisation of networking services; SDN/NFV based solutions; Networking; Network orchestration;
- Orchestration of computing resources in the following applicative domains: Smart City; Smart Industry; Smart Grid; Smart Agriculture; Smart Health.

Submission guidelines:
All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous revision process adopted by Journal of Grid Computing. Please submit a full-length paper through the Journal of Grid Computing online submission system (https://www.editorialmanager.com/grid/default.aspx) and indicate that it is for this special issue. Papers should be formatted by following Journal of Grid Computing manuscript formatting guidelines and must not exceed 18 pages.
