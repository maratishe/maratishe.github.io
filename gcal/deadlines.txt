- Paper submission deadline: March 18, 2021 (23:59 AoE)
- Author notification: April 29, 2021
- Camera-ready deadline: May 21, 2021 (23:59 AoE)
- WiSec conference: June 28 to July 1, 2021


Full and short papers
=====================

Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2021 can be up to 10 pages in the
ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the
submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including
bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more
succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available
on the WiSec 2021 website at https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.

For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by
the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and
included in the proceedings.


Posters and demos
=================

WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.


Replicability label
===================

WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to
minimize the overhead of applying for this label.
The process of reviewing the work for replicability will be largely
similar to the previous years.


Double submissions
==================

It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals
involved.


Workshops and Tutorial

INTELLIGENT & RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD
https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/
JULY 12-16, 2021

***CALL FOR PAPERS***

MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 18, 2021

Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis.  Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication.  Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely.  These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities.  But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered.  Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently.  In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses.  As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported.  How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing.  How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users?  For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!

COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.

***SUBMISSION***
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 & C1J2 program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Publishing Policies, and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck portal.

The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.

 

The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.

 

TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications.  We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 

- Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification

Special Issue on Embracing Artificial Intelligence for Network and Service Management

 

https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp

 

(Submissions due: 1 April 2021)

 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can harness the immense amount of operational data from clouds, to services, to social and communication networks. In the era of big data and connected devices of all varieties, artificial intelligence has found ways to improve operations and management of information technology services, systems and networks.

 

Research is therefore needed to understand and improve the potential and suitability of artificial intelligence in the context of services, systems and network management. This will provide deeper understanding and better decision making based on largely collected and available operational and service data. It will also present opportunities for improving artificial intelligence algorithms on aspects such as reliability, dependability and scalability, as well as demonstrate the benefits of these methods in management and control systems. Moreover, there is an opportunity to define novel platforms that can harness the vast operational data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to drive management decisions in networks, data centers, and clouds.

 

IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of four recent TNSM special issues on Data Analytics for Management in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 this special issue will also focus on recent, emerging approaches and technical models that exploits artificial intelligence in network and service management solutions. We welcome submissions addressing the underlying challenges and opportunities, presenting novel techniques, experimental results, or theoretical approaches motivated by management problems. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges and opportunities for future research are also in the scope of the special issue. We look forward to your submissions!

Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation.  The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.

This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:

Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling
Medium access control design
Data centers and cloud systems
Radio access technology selection

CALL FOR PAPERS
IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS 2021)
25-28 June 2021, Tokyo, Japan
https://iwqos2021.ieee-iwqos.org/

Quality of Service (QoS) has long been the focus of communications and
networking researchers worldwide. While traditional QoS research areas
continue attracting much interest, recent exploration of Internet of
things, data centers, virtualization, cloud and fog computing, green
computing, and AI has motivated a new wave of research interest in
service guarantees with QoS, and its related metrics of Quality of
Experience (QoE), Quality of Protection (QoP), Software Quality, Data
Quality, or, more broadly, Quality of Information Technology.

For more than two decades, IWQoS has established itself as a highly
reputable forum to present novel ideas on all QoS-related subjects. The
29th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IEEE/ACM IWQoS 2021)
