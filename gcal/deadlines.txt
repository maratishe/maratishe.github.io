ACM SIGCOMM 2021
August 23–27, 2021
Virtual Event
http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/

***Important dates***
-       Jan 20, 2021, 16:59 EST -- Abstract registration deadline
-       Jan 27, 2021, 16:59 EST -- Paper submission deadline
-       May 3, 2021 (tentative) -- Notification date


***Call for Papers***

The ACM SIGCOMM 2021 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of communication networks and networked systems.
SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking research, which includes (but is not limited to) the following topics:

-       All types of computer networks such as mobile, wide-area, data-center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks.
-       All types of wired and wireless technologies, including optics, and acoustic and visible light-based communication.
-       All aspects of networks and networked systems such as architecture, packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness, security, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, and interactions with applications.
-       All types of computer network design, analysis, and experimental approaches such as theory, measurements, and machine learning-based techniques.

We want each SIGCOMM paper to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in networking by, for instance, proposing and developing novel ideas or rigorously (re-)evaluating existing ideas. The review process will take the nature of the contribution into account. We strongly encourage authors to discuss not only the benefits but also the limitations of their work.

SIGCOMM 2021 will accept submissions to the ***experience track*** in addition to the regular research track. Submissions to the experience track describe the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial or otherwise widely-used deployment. Experience track submissions need not describe new ideas, but are strongly encouraged to elucidate key insights and takeaways gathered from design, deployment, or operational experience. The PC will evaluate experience-track submissions with the understanding that the primary contributions may be in extending the SIGCOMM community’s knowledge of how known techniques fare when adapted to real-world settings, and particularly in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate, for reasons of scale or otherwise. At paper registration time, authors must explicitly indicate both in their paper title and submission form if their paper is to be considered for the experience or regular research track. Submissions to the experience track should also be double-blind. However, given the nature of these papers, it is OK to reveal company or system name but NOT author names. Each submission will only be considered for one track – either the experience or the research track, but not both – in accordance with the authors’ preference expressed at submission time. The final conference program will not preserve the distinction between the two tracks.

In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2021 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.


***Submissions***

Papers submitted to SIGCOMM typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. The program committee will judge submissions based upon novelty, significance, correctness, clarity of presentation, and relevance to the SIGCOMM community. All accepted papers will be shepherded by a member of the program committee.

Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.

Submissions and final papers may include appendices (following references, not counting against the 12 pages). Reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result. For accepted papers, the shepherd will review appendices and must approve their need. Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, and code, all appropriately anonymized.

NOTE: For accepted papers, the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

Detailed submission instructions can be found here -- http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/submission.html

Submission site: https://sigcomm2021.hotcrp.com


***Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers***

The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2021 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary but strongly encouraged and it has no influence on the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here -- https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging


***Public Summaries for Accepted Papers***

The SIGCOMM 2021 program will feature public summaries accompanying each accepted paper. In most cases, the summary will be written by the paper’s shepherd and will provide an overview of the problem addressed in the paper and its solution, and highlight interesting future questions that arise. The summary may additionally explain aspects of the paper the reviewers particularly liked. Summaries will be published along with the papers in the ACM Digital Library.


***Ethical Concerns***

All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement about ethical issues; papers that don’t include such a statement may be rejected. This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.” If the work involves human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, perhaps in a separate subsection.

Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if human subjects are involved or other people are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report (https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) and the ACM ethics policy (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007 (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.

Many organizations have an ethics review process (sometimes called an Institutional Review Board, IRB). In some cases, research work may clearly have no human subjects, and formal institutional review may not be required. (However, a sentence in the paper stating this evaluation is still required.) In many cases, IRB involvement is appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor (and should be mentioned), but the program committee will independently evaluate the ethical soundness of the work just as they evaluate its technical soundness.

The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and the PC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if questions arise.

You can contact the PC chairs at akella@cs.wisc.edu and nanditad@google.com

MDPI Drones - Special Issue 

Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms 

Submission Deadline: 31 December 2020 

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC 

 

Dear Colleagues, 

In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed. 

This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications. 

Possible topics include but are not limited to:  

Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC; 
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms; 
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC; 
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC; 
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT); 
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC; 
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC; 
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC; 
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC; 
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications; 
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

Special Issue on Mobile and Edge Computing Systems




The ubiquitous deployment of mobile computing platforms and embedded Internet of Things devices have catalyzed the development of various computing services deeply embedded to our everyday lives. Recently with relatively more powerful edge platforms, computationally heavy tasks that could not be previously enabled using resource limited mobile and embedded platforms can be realized to enable a richer set of localized services. The combination of mobile and edge computing systems has enabled the use of tasks such as various deep learning techniques and computationally heavy blockchains to mobile and embedded computing scenarios, but have also introduced new challenges related to utilizing the limited resources, maintaining user privacy and preserving energy efficiency.

 

The objective of this special issue is to explore recent advances in mobile and edge computing systems to address practical and fundamental challenges. Networking, security, and AI-based schemes to support mobile and edge computing systems as well as application designs are all potential topics that can collectively tackle such challenges. Specifically, potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

 

●   Intelligent deployment of mobile and edge computing systems

●   Deep learning technologies for mobile and edge computing

●   Novel communication and network paradigms for mobile and edge computing

●   Latency and energy-aware computing

●   Deep learning model offloading

●   Intelligent security and privacy provisioning for mobile and edge computing platforms and systems

The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021)
IEEE-CS TCI

23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy

http://www.ficloud.org/2021/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.

The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.

IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.

The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.

  Special Issue on "Theoretical Models and Simulations for New Mobile-Computing Architectures"

Scope:
======

In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new
path rearrangements.

This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.


The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:

Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;
Complex systems and networks;
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;
Simulation of mobile network structures;
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation.  The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.

This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:

Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling

***Call for Papers***
 
Current communication networks are increasingly becoming pervasive, complex, and ever-evolving due to factors like enormous growth in the number of network users, continuous appearance of network applications, increasing amount of data transferred, and diversity of user behaviors. Understanding and measuring traffic in such networks is a difficult yet vital task for network management but recently also for cybersecurity purposes. Network traffic measuring and monitoring can, for example, enable the analysis of the spreading of malicious software and its capabilities or can help to understand the nature of various network threats including those that exploit users' behavior and other user's sensitive information. On the other hand network traffic investigation can also help to assess the effectiveness of the existing countermeasures or contribute to building new, better ones. Recently, traffic measurements have been utilized in the area of economics of cybersecurity e.g. to assess ISP "badness" or to estimate the revenue of cybercriminals.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research accomplishments provided by researchers from academia and the industry. The other goal is to show the latest research results in the field of cybersecurity and understand how traffic measurements can influence it. We encourage prospective authors to submit related distinguished research papers on the subject of both: theoretical approaches and practical case reviews. This workshop presents some of the most relevant ongoing research in cybersecurity seen from the traffic measurements perspective. The workshop will be accessible to both non-experts interested in learning about this area and experts interested in hearing about new research and approaches.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
 
+ Measurements for network incidents response, investigation, and evidence handling
+ Measurements of cyber attacks (e.g. DDoS, botnet, malware, and phishing campaigns)
+ Measurements for security of web-based applications and services (e.g. social networking)
+ Measurements for network anomalies detection
+ Measurements for economics of cybersecurity and privacy
+ Measurements of security and privacy for the Internet of Things
+ Measurements of Internet censorship
+ Measurement studies describing the impacts of regulations on cybersecurity and users' privacy (e.g. GDPR)
+ Network traffic analysis to discover the nature and evolution of the cybersecurity threats
+ Measurements of cyber-physical systems security
+ Measurements for assessing the effectiveness of the threats detection/prevention methods and countermeasures
+ Novel passive, active and hybrid measurements techniques for cybersecurity purposes
+ Traffic classification and topology discovery tools for monitoring the evolving status of the network from the cybersecurity perspective
+ Correlation of measurements across multiple layers, protocols or networks for cybersecurity purposes
+ Machine learning and data mining for analysis of network traffic measurements for cybersecurity
+ Novel approaches for large-scale measurements for cybersecurity (e.g. crowd-sourcing)
+ Novel visualization approaches to detect network attacks and other threats
+ Analysis of network traffic to provide new insights about network structure and behavior from the security perspective
+ Measurements of network protocol and applications behavior and its impact on cybersecurity and users' privacy
+ Vulnerability notifications
+ Measurements for new cybersecurity settings
+ Ethical issues in measurements for cybersecurity
+ Reappraisal of previous empirical findings
 
***Submission Instructions***
 
Papers will be accepted based on peer review (3-4 per paper) and should contain original, high-quality work. All papers must be written in English.

Authors are invited to submit regular papers (maximum 6 pages) including references and appendices via EasyChair. Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. The text must be formatted in a two-column layout, with columns no more than 9.5 in. tall and 3.5 in. wide. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Authors are encouraged to use the IEEE conference proceedings templates. LaTeX submissions should use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements will be grounds for rejection.

Papers describing cybersecurity measurement studies should include an ethical considerations paragraph, and where applicable reach out to their institutional ethics committee or institutional review board. For guidance see the Menlo Report and its companion document.

Authors are encouraged to share developed software implementations, measurement datasets, simulation models, etc. used in articles allowing other researchers to build upon and extend current results. Authors may include a paragraph about reproducible research.

Submission page: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wtmc2021

Submission of a paper implies that should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and present the paper at the conference.

Papers accepted by the workshop will be published through IEEE Xplore in a volume accompanying the main IEEE S&P conference proceedings. All WTMC workshop authors are also invited to present a poster during the IEEE S&P Symposium. The extended versions of all accepted papers will be considered for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility (confirmed). The decision will depend on the quality of the paper and the quality of the presentation at WTMC 2021. The final decision will be made by co-chairs after the workshop.
