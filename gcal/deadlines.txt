CALL FOR PAPERS

Elsevier Online Social Networks and Media Journal (OSNEM)

Special issue on
Online Social Networks and Media: human behaviour under big data microscopes

Submission Deadline: June 30th, 2021
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/online-social-networks-and-media
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Online Social Networks and Media are a fundamental component of the cyber-physical convergences, representing one of the main bridges between the human behaviour across the physical and virtual worlds. Therefore, the “trails” users leave behind while using OSNEM can be mined, via big data analytics and AI, to characterize individual and social human behaviours at an unprecedented scale. Moreover, the speed at which events can be detected via OSNEM data analysis makes OSNEM a prime way to monitor the evolution of human behaviours and nowcast their development and consequences in both the physical and virtual worlds. For example, OSNEM can be used to shed light, through big data analysis, on the diffusion of COVID-19 in the real world.

This special issue seeks contributions pushing the state of the art in all facets of the use of OSNEM as big data microscopes to investigate complex human individual and social behaviours. We solicit manuscripts presenting quantitative analysis and modelling based on BigData collected from OSNEM.

Within this framework, topics include, but are not limited to:
- Analysis of social structures via OSNEM
- Analysis and modelling of information and opinion dynamics in OSNEM
- Early detection of critical phenomena in the cyber and physical worlds
- Prediction of (near-)future events based on OSNEM data analysis
- OSNEM monitoring and analysis for the protection of users and critical infrastructures
- Mobility characterization and modelling
- Characterisation of users’ behaviour in smart cities
- OSNEM data-driven approaches to study COVID-19 related phenomena
- Pandemic tracking and control via OSNEM big data analysis
- Models of individual and social behaviour through OSNEM big data during the pandemic
- OSNEM users’ characterization for mass customization of products and services
- Analysis of large social phenomena (e.g., political movements) via OSNEM big data
- Privacy-preserving big data analytics for human behaviour characterisation
- Efficient methodologies for large-scale OSNEM data collection and analysis

Online Social Networks and Media is a multidisciplinary journal for the wide community of computer and network scientists working on developing OSNEM platforms and services and using OSNEM as a big data source to mine, learn and model the (online) human behaviour.
Manuscripts only based on questionnaires, even focused on the reported use of social media, are outside the scope of the journal. On the other hand, the journal welcomes papers which present analyses based on big data mined from social networks/media.

IEEE Security & Privacy

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Security and Privacy Issues of Home
Globalization

In recent years, people have been reshaping their homes into smart homes
by using a wide array of home-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
including inter-connected lights, locks, sensors, actuators, wearables,
and appliances accessible through the Internet and controlled locally
(e.g., via voice) or remotely (e.g., via mobile phone). These smart home
devices are complemented by laptops, mobile phones, game consoles,
electronical health equipment, and many other consumer IoT nodes, which
are constantly used at home for work, pleasure, health, and
entertainment, just to mention the most common purposes. The emerging
pervasiveness of IoT technologies is transforming homes into globalized
homes in which devices supporting everyday activities can be accessed
from anywhere. Although home globalization has its benefits, it also
covertly renders homes more insecure and less private places where
individuals are exposed to more and more varying threats from the
outside world.

Despite the benefits, home globalization and the used technologies have
led to many security threats and privacy breaches. In fact, home-based
IoT technologies at the basis of globalized homes are becoming prone to
abuses including adaptations of well-known cyber-attacks leveraging the
variety of data and devices populating modern apartments and houses. In
addition, both home-based and consumer IoT frameworks collect and manage
information that is tightly coupled with the everyday life of
individuals and can thus be considered a source of sensitive data that
is of interest for profiling or reconnaissance attempts. Therefore, the
resulting home globalization requires us to face new threats and risks
leading to different challenges. In fact, modern homes are
technologically balkanized with services provided via different
technologies (IEEE 802.15.4, home/consumer IoT, voice-based assistants)
and by multiple vendors (device and software) often by using a cloud- or
fog-based scheme. Additional challenges stem from the relatively covert
introduction of new risks during home globalization, as people tend to
put more focus on functionalities of new smart devices than the security
and privacy implications of their use. In this perspective, enforcing
security and privacy in such a scenario requires rethinking and
developing new defenses and solutions, as well as addressing new social
challenges for law enforcement agencies, policy makers, and forensics
professionals.

This special issue aims at collecting the most relevant ongoing research
efforts in the security and privacy field concerning home globalization.
Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Security management of home-based and consumer IoT
- Network security of globalized homes
- Adoption of cybersecurity measures in globalized homes, including
child safety
- Surveillance, interception, blocking, and sovereignty in home-based
IoT environments
- De-anonymization, AI-based social inference, integrity, and privacy leaks
- Stealth communication, information hiding threats, and their detection
in home-based IoT environments
- Cybercrime investigation, law, jurisdiction, and ethics in home-based
IoT environments
