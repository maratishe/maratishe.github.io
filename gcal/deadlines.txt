Call for Workshop Proposals -- IEEE PerCom 2022

* Important Dates *

- Workshop proposal submission deadline: July 2nd, 2021
- Notification: July 26th, 2021

IEEE PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and
communications. Pervasive computing has not only been a vivid research area,
but also found its way into many commercial and consumer systems and
applications due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies
and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing,
sensor and actuator systems, ambient intelligence, and smart mobile and
embedded devices. Due to the pervasiveness of such systems, users become
central in the development and realization of innovative pervasive systems.
Advances in all these fields have led to innovative platforms,
protocols, systems, and applications but still a lot can be done to improve their
quality, sustainability and acceptance.

In 2022, PerCom will be held in Pisa, which is known for its precious gothic
and renaissance-style buildings including the world-famous leaning tower as
well as art and culture in general. Currently, PerCom 2022 is planned as a
hybrid event, partly in presence, partly virtual, with the option to adapt
to the dynamic pandemic situation.

The PerCom 2022 Organizing Committee invites proposals for one-day or
half-day workshops, to be held prior to or immediately after the main
conference. The purpose of the workshops is to stimulate discussions on
state-of-the-art, emerging, visionary, and also controversial topics.
Workshops should be organized to promote lively interaction, and plans to
promote interaction and discussion must be clearly addressed in the written
workshop proposals. The organizers of accepted workshops are required to
publicize the workshop through disseminating the call for papers, solicit
submissions, conduct the reviewing process, and decide upon the final
workshop program. At least one organizer must be physically present at the
workshop. We are aware that the possibility to visit Pisa depends on the
future pandemic situation and of course only applies under the assumption
that PerCom can take place as a hybrid event (at least partially in presence).
So organizers should plan on a best-effort basis, possibly including
organizers from different locations, for instance, to limit the risk of
travel restrictions.

Workshop proposals are solicited in all areas and topics pertaining to
research and applications in pervasive computing and communications. Workshops
addressing new emerging research directions in pervasive computing and
communication are especially welcome. Further, workshops with novel formats,
e.g., focused on a specific topic in a tutorial-style fashion, are strongly
encouraged. Workshop papers will be included and indexed in the IEEE digital
library (Xplore). The page limit for accepted regular workshop papers is 6
pages, including all figures, tables, and references.

* Workshop Proposal Submission Instructions *

Workshop proposals should be submitted (in PDF format) no later than

  July 2nd, 2021

by e-mail to

  percom2022-workshops@iit.cnr.it

with "PerCom 2022 Workshop Proposal" in the subject.

Each workshop proposal must include:

1. The workshop title and acronym.

2. The name, address, and a short bio of up to 200 words for each of the
workshop organizers; workshops may have up to three organizers. It is strongly
recommended that organizers belong to at least two different institutions.

a) the technical issues that the workshop will address,
b) the reasons the workshop is of interest to the PerCom community,
c) a description of the communities/groups the workshop aims to attract,
d) a short discussion of related workshops and conferences and an outline
of why the proposed workshop is unique.

4. The planned format of the workshop (e.g., keynotes, paper presentations,
posters, demos) and duration (e.g., one-day, half-day). You must also provide
a well-defined strategy to facilitate lively and interactive discussions. In
your plan, please also consider the hybrid or (depending on the situation)
fully virtual format and outline, how you could support an engaging workshop.
You can also take advantage of the infrastructure provide by PerCom (Zoom,
GatherTown, Slack, etc.)

5. A description of past editions of the workshop (if the workshop had
already been held before), including the number of submitted and accepted
papers and number of attendees. Please also address any differences
between the proposed edition of the workshop and the previous edition(s).
OR, if the workshop is new, an estimate of the expected number of submitted
and accepted papers, and of the expected number of attendees.

6. A description of the publicity plan.

7. The names of potential program committee members.

8. The workshop website address.

Special Issue on Federated Deep Learning-Empowered Internet of Vehicles

 

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is designed to seamlessly connect smart vehicles, road infrastructures, communication facilities and users. The goal is to provide a comprehensive environment overview, improve transportation efficiency and reduce road accidents. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning, is essential for the progress of intelligent IoV. However, with the growing complexity of on-board sensors, the big raw data sets available for deep learning can give rise to concerns over data security and privacy, as well as huge communication overheads.

 

Distributed machine learning among smart vehicles and edge-cloud entities based on federated deep learning (FDL) is helping to address these challenges.  FDL allows a central server to cooperate with multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model. Clients upload parameters of the trained model to the central server and keep their training data locally, thus significantly reducing the communication costs and the data privacy risks. Although FDL has great potential for intelligent IoV, further research is required in some areas. For example, the trade-off optimisation between Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption in intelligent IoV, the efficient design of learning models in FDL for different intelligent IoV problems, communication efficiency for heterogeneous IoV technologies, and the security and privacy issues related to FDL under the dynamic IoV environment.

 

The objective of this special issue is to assemble high-quality research papers on emerging theories, frameworks, architectures and algorithms for solving the challenging problems related to FDL- empowered intelligent IoV. It will also offer an open platform for scholars and engineers to exchange their recent novel ideas and explore the potential convergence of existing intelligent IoV systems and advanced FDL technologies.

Topics Covered:

Novel FDL algorithms for intelligent IoV systems and applications
Architectures and models for FDL-empowered IoV
Theory and protocols for FDL-empowered IoV
Resource management for FDL-empowered IoV
Communication-efficiency in FDL-empowered IoV
Big data and data analytics in FDL-empowered IoV
Traffic and network status predictions in FDL-empowered IoV
Performance optimisation for FDL-empowered IoV
Energy-efficiency in FDL-empowered IoV
Security and privacy in FDL-empowered IoV
Convergence of blockchain and FDL-empowered IoV
Use cases and real-world experiments for FDL-empowered IoV
Important Deadlines:

Submission deadline: 31 July 2021
Acceptance deadline: 30 Jan 2022
Publication date: March 2022
Submission Instructions:

Please read the Guide for Authors before submitting. All articles should be submitted online via the editorial management system. Please select the option ‘SI: FDL-IoV’.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Elsevier Online Social Networks and Media Journal (OSNEM)

Special issue on
Online Social Networks and Media: human behaviour under big data microscopes

Submission Deadline: June 30th, 2021
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/online-social-networks-and-media
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Online Social Networks and Media are a fundamental component of the cyber-physical convergences, representing one of the main bridges between the human behaviour across the physical and virtual worlds. Therefore, the “trails” users leave behind while using OSNEM can be mined, via big data analytics and AI, to characterize individual and social human behaviours at an unprecedented scale. Moreover, the speed at which events can be detected via OSNEM data analysis makes OSNEM a prime way to monitor the evolution of human behaviours and nowcast their development and consequences in both the physical and virtual worlds. For example, OSNEM can be used to shed light, through big data analysis, on the diffusion of COVID-19 in the real world.

This special issue seeks contributions pushing the state of the art in all facets of the use of OSNEM as big data microscopes to investigate complex human individual and social behaviours. We solicit manuscripts presenting quantitative analysis and modelling based on BigData collected from OSNEM.

Within this framework, topics include, but are not limited to:
- Analysis of social structures via OSNEM
- Analysis and modelling of information and opinion dynamics in OSNEM
- Early detection of critical phenomena in the cyber and physical worlds
- Prediction of (near-)future events based on OSNEM data analysis
- OSNEM monitoring and analysis for the protection of users and critical infrastructures
- Mobility characterization and modelling
- Characterisation of users’ behaviour in smart cities
- OSNEM data-driven approaches to study COVID-19 related phenomena
- Pandemic tracking and control via OSNEM big data analysis
- Models of individual and social behaviour through OSNEM big data during the pandemic
- OSNEM users’ characterization for mass customization of products and services
- Analysis of large social phenomena (e.g., political movements) via OSNEM big data
- Privacy-preserving big data analytics for human behaviour characterisation
- Efficient methodologies for large-scale OSNEM data collection and analysis

Online Social Networks and Media is a multidisciplinary journal for the wide community of computer and network scientists working on developing OSNEM platforms and services and using OSNEM as a big data source to mine, learn and model the (online) human behaviour.
Manuscripts only based on questionnaires, even focused on the reported use of social media, are outside the scope of the journal. On the other hand, the journal welcomes papers which present analyses based on big data mined from social networks/media.

IEEE Security & Privacy
=======================

Call for Papers: Special Issue on Security and Privacy Issues of Home
Globalization

In recent years, people have been reshaping their homes into smart homes
by using a wide array of home-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
including inter-connected lights, locks, sensors, actuators, wearables,
and appliances accessible through the Internet and controlled locally
(e.g., via voice) or remotely (e.g., via mobile phone). These smart home
devices are complemented by laptops, mobile phones, game consoles,
electronical health equipment, and many other consumer IoT nodes, which
are constantly used at home for work, pleasure, health, and
entertainment, just to mention the most common purposes. The emerging
pervasiveness of IoT technologies is transforming homes into globalized
homes in which devices supporting everyday activities can be accessed
from anywhere. Although home globalization has its benefits, it also
covertly renders homes more insecure and less private places where
individuals are exposed to more and more varying threats from the
outside world.

Despite the benefits, home globalization and the used technologies have
led to many security threats and privacy breaches. In fact, home-based
IoT technologies at the basis of globalized homes are becoming prone to
abuses including adaptations of well-known cyber-attacks leveraging the
variety of data and devices populating modern apartments and houses. In
addition, both home-based and consumer IoT frameworks collect and manage
information that is tightly coupled with the everyday life of
individuals and can thus be considered a source of sensitive data that
is of interest for profiling or reconnaissance attempts. Therefore, the
resulting home globalization requires us to face new threats and risks
leading to different challenges. In fact, modern homes are
technologically balkanized with services provided via different
technologies (IEEE 802.15.4, home/consumer IoT, voice-based assistants)
and by multiple vendors (device and software) often by using a cloud- or
fog-based scheme. Additional challenges stem from the relatively covert
introduction of new risks during home globalization, as people tend to
put more focus on functionalities of new smart devices than the security
and privacy implications of their use. In this perspective, enforcing
security and privacy in such a scenario requires rethinking and
developing new defenses and solutions, as well as addressing new social
challenges for law enforcement agencies, policy makers, and forensics
professionals.

This special issue aims at collecting the most relevant ongoing research
efforts in the security and privacy field concerning home globalization.
Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Security management of home-based and consumer IoT
- Network security of globalized homes
- Adoption of cybersecurity measures in globalized homes, including
child safety
- Surveillance, interception, blocking, and sovereignty in home-based
IoT environments
- De-anonymization, AI-based social inference, integrity, and privacy leaks
- Stealth communication, information hiding threats, and their detection
in home-based IoT environments
- Cybercrime investigation, law, jurisdiction, and ethics in home-based
IoT environments
