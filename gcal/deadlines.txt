    CALL FOR PAPERS

  Special Issue on "Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods"

                MDPI IoT Journal



Dear Colleagues,

The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).

Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.

For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources' placement (e.g., EC capable drones)

Special Issue Website: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/IoT/special_issues/edge_computing_AI

This special issue is now open for submission, until 30 June 2021.

MDPI Drones - Special Issue 

Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms 

Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm FEC 

 

Dear Colleagues, 

In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed. 

This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications. 

Possible topics include but are not limited to:  

Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC; 
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms; 
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC; 
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC; 
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT); 
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC; 
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC; 
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC; 
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC; 
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications; 
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

 CALL FOR PAPERS

   Special Issue on "Theoretical Models and Simulations for New
Mobile-Computing Architectures"

                                     MDPI - Telecom Journal

https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Dates:
================

Submission deadline: February 21st, 2021 -> EXTENDED to July 31st, 2021

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope:
======

In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been
proposed in the scientific
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at
enhancing the quality of service
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing,
especially in 5G, has been
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness),
but at the same time, different
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for
example, that user mobility
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations,
strictly related to the average
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move
among different coverage areas
in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce).
Traffic flowing may be also
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in
relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise
also in distributed
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols
suffer high overheads for new
path rearrangements.

This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing
a point of interest for the
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches
or a mixture of them,
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of
theoretical models regarding
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years,
especially if predictive
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original
quality and high-level technical
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile
networking, via the introduction of
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm
intelligence, evolutionary
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.


The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to,
the following areas of interest:

Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their
execution using optimized simulation algorithms;
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;
Complex systems and networks;
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile
networks;
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with
mobile nodes;
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;
Simulation of mobile network structures;
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

CALL FOR PAPERS Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Special Issue on “AI Drives Our Future Life”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SUMMARY


While “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) becomes the mainstream of application techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented. AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications, self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI, such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both academic and industrial communities. Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g., cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).



Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation, realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the performance and energy efficiency for various computation and memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI for

various domains to share new findings among the community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.

Applied Energy (Impact Factor 8.848)  - Special Issue on "Energy Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Network – Moving towards Real Implementation"

 

Over the last few years, there has been extensive growth in small-scale distributed energy resources (DER), which encompass behind-the-meter generation, energy storage, inverters, electric vehicles, and controllable loads at the household level. These small-scale resources can be utilized not only to manage the energy demand more efficiently but also to enable a significant mix of clean energy into the grid. However, to do so, it is important for the owners of these assets to actively participate in the energy market. As a consequence, peer-to-peer trading has emerged as a next-generation energy management technique for the smart grid that can enable the owners of small scale DERs - also known as prosumers - to actively participate in the energy market. With the prosumers in control of setting the terms of transactions and the delivery of goods and services, it is expected that the gain that the prosumers can reap from participating in peer-to-peer trading would be substantial. At the same time, the grid — consisting of generators, retailers, and distribution network system providers — can also obtain a significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand, lowering investment and operational costs, minimizing reserve requirements, and improving power system reliability.

 

As a result, a large number of studies have been reported on peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks over the past few years. These studies have focused on a number of important decision-making problems of participants in the virtual layer as well as investigated the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on the physical distribution network. A large number of pilot projects have also been established in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, interestingly, there has been no indication of the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the actual energy market in any country. The purpose of this special section is to address this gap by publishing findings from innovative research that have the potential to establish peer-to-peer sharing in today’s electricity market as an energy trading mechanism. The published articles will demonstrate a set of new research outcomes that can successfully decide on energy trading parameters that are beneficial not only for the prosumers but also for other stakeholders within the market. At the same time, transacted energy by prosumers over the physical layer will not detrimentally impact the physical power system network in terms of violating any constraints and increasing the loss significantly.

 

The targeted audience includes both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The purpose of the special issue is to provide a platform to enhance interdisciplinary research and share the most recent ideas in the above-related fields. In particular, the published article would cover, but not limited to, the following topics of energy system via designing new peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms:

·        Electricity market regulation

·        Sharing of energy storage

·        Providing demand flexibility to the grid

·        Trading of renewable energy in microgrid

·        Designing prosumer engagement plans 

·        Modelling flexibility of distributed energy resources

·        Providing voltage and frequency regulation service 

·        Pricing model

·        Minimizing of network loss

Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments



https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments

 

CALL FOR PAPERS 

 

***************

 

Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.

 

A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.

 

Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

**** Aims and Scope ****

It is undeniable that the cities' urbanisation has modernised people's
lives, bringing several benefits to the population. However, it has also
brought serious challenges such as public management of collective
spaces, air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and
quality of life. In this context, Urban Computing emerges as a process
of acquisition, integration, and analysis of a large volume of
heterogeneous data generated from different sources in urban spaces,
such as portable devices, sensors, vehicles, humans, among others. Urban
Computing is an interdisciplinary area that connects information and
communication technology, advanced management of large volumes of data,
and diverse data analysis methods to propose solutions to problems faced
by cities. In addition, Urban Computing seeks to understand the nature
of urban and social phenomena to better plan the future of cities and
improve their inhabitants' quality of life.

UrbCom aims to create a space for: (1) presentation and discussion of
studies in the area of Urban Computing; (2) collaboration between
researchers from different areas that, given the interdisciplinary
nature, is not limited to Computer Science.

Information - an Open Access Journal by MDPI
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Cyberphysical_Cloud_Engineering)

Dear Colleagues,

At present, computers, smart sensors and devices are pervasive, and
computational processes are increasingly becoming transparent to
humans, making up the very fabric of contemporary societies. In this
context, the cyberphysical system (CPS) paradigm is thriving. CPS
refers to the integration of computation with physical processes. A
CPS uses sensors and actuators to link the computational systems to
the physical world. Through the instrumentation of the physical world,
it is possible to monitor several variables and transfer data to
cyberspace, where applications and services use such data to make
decisions that affect and control physical processes, in a feedback
loop. The ultimate goal of this integration is to improve processes,
making them more effective and optimized, increasing productivity for
companies and quality of life for citizens.

The recent advancement of computational intelligence techniques has
leveraged the new generation of CPS, which is known as smart
cyberphysical systems (sCPS). sCPS are distributed and
software-intensive systems that, from heterogeneous data sources, both
physical and virtual, and from their processing using computational
intelligence paradigms, are able to efficiently and autonomously
manage real-world processes. Such systems have the potential to
optimize and support a wide range of application domains.

The growing scale, in terms of devices and data, of modern sCPS and
the need to perform complex processing and provide fast responses
makes cloud–edge platforms natural candidates for integrating such
systems. By applying the model and principles of cloud computing to
sCPS, any virtual or physical device, including sensors and actuators,
is available as a service and can quickly and autonomously be
provisioned for usage to meet the user and application demands. By
leveraging the edge computing paradigm, time constraints of CPS can be
dealt with.

In this context, this Special Issue intends to explore the multiple
aspects of sCPS and the role of cloud–edge computing as an integrating
and enabling platform for this paradigm. Potential topics of interest
include but are not limited to the following:

Cloud/edge/cloud–edge computing and services for cyberphysical systems;
Resource management in cloud–edge-based sCPS;
sCPS as a service;
Design, implementation, and operation of cloud/edge/cloud–edge
platforms for sCPS;
Practical design issues in building cloud–edge-based sCPS;
Managing big data for sCPS;
Programming models, benchmarks, and tools for cloud-based sCPS;
Virtualization models for sCPS;
Architectures and frameworks for sCPS;
Interoperability issues in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;
Solutions for reliability and resilience in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;
Self-adaptation, self-healing, and self-configuration in sCPS;
Real-time data analytics and data stream processing for sCPS;
Context-aware event processing for sCPS;
Internet of Things and real-time services for sCPS;
Security challenges in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS.

Special Issue on Edge Intelligence for Sustainable Smart Environments

https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tgcn/cfp/edge-intelligence-sustainable-smart-environments

CALL FOR PAPERS 

***************

Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.

A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.

Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.

ACM SIGCOMM 2021

August 23–27, 2021

Virtual Event

http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/

 

***CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS***

https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/cf-tutorials.html

 

+ Deadline for proposals – April 9, 2021

+ Notification of acceptance – April 30, 2021

 

We seek to extend the SIGCOMM experience by tutorials on selected topics given by renowned scientists and practitioners in their fields. We therefore solicit proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community. Keep in mind that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SIGCOMM 2021 will be held fully online.

 

Tutorials must cover advanced topics that fit the scope of SIGCOMM and are of current interest to the SIGCOMM community.  Tutorials may be lectures, interactive workshops, hands-on training, or any combination of the above. Successful tutorials educate the community members on emerging methods, concepts, and tools to expand the research capabilities of the community. Cross-disciplinary topics are also welcome.  Exploring diverse ways of organizing the content, delivering the tutorial, and interacting with the audience in an online format are especially encouraged.

 

 

***WHERE TO SUBMIT***

 

Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, should not exceed three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the Tutorial Chairs by email to chenyang@fudan.edu.cn and retvari@tmit.bme.hu, with the subject “[SIGCOMM 2021] Tutorial Proposal”.

 

 

**WHAT TO SUBMIT?***

 

- A motivation for the tutorial (why this, why now, why at SIGCOMM?)

 

- An outline of the tutorial content, including its tentative schedule (over a half-day or full-day)

 

- The type of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on). It is highly recommended that full-day tutorials should include a hands-on component and not be limited to only lectures. Hands-on components are well-known to be more engaging and pedagogically better in teaching for full-day events.

 

- References to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable) including their date, venue, topics and number of participants and the motivation for the new proposal.

 

- Special requirements for the online tutorial (please note that our capabilities in fulfilling unusual requests are limited). A Zoom and a dedicated Slack channel will be provided.

 

- Requirements for the attendees (e.g., must have their own laptop or other hardware, familiarity with certain technologies or topics, speed of Internet connection, artifacts to download beforehand, etc.)

 

- A clear indication whether or not the tutorial artifacts (slides, video, notebooks, containers/VMs, etc.) are allowed to be posted publicly at the conference website.

 

 

***IMPORTANT NOTES***

 

- Each tutorial will be scheduled at a particular time slot on Monday and/or Friday on the week of the main SIGCOMM conference, possibly in parallel with the workshops. This is to foster interaction with the audience. Purely offline tutorials with pre-recorded video and no online delivery are not acceptable.

 

- Preference in the acceptance decision process will be given to tutorial submissions that (1) provide hands-on experience to the attendees, (2) strive to exploit the opportunities provided by the online format (i.e., use Jupyter notebooks for hands-on material, offer preinstalled VMs/containers, etc.), and (3) build on open content that can be freely posted on the conference website.

 

- It is recommended that there are up to three speakers for a full-day tutorial and up to two speakers for a half-day tutorial. It is a good idea to have another person available to feed the interactive questions from Slack channel to the presenters online.

 

- Upon acceptance of a tutorial proposal, either the tutorial co-chair or the tutorial speakers can request a cancellation of the tutorial if there is clear evidence indicating low attendance of the tutorial by the early registration deadline.

 

- Compensation to tutorial speakers will not be provided.

- Camera-ready deadline: May 21, 2021 (23:59 AoE)
- WiSec conference: June 28 to July 1, 2021


Full and short papers
=====================

Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2021 can be up to 10 pages in the
ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the
submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including

succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available
on the WiSec 2021 website at https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.

For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by
the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and
included in the proceedings.


Posters and demos
=================

WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.


Replicability label
===================

WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to
minimize the overhead of applying for this label. The process of
reviewing the work for replicability will be largely similar to the
previous years.


Double submissions
==================

It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals
involved.
