In-Cooperation Status with ACM SIGCOMM


The 17th  International Conference  on Network and  Service Management
(CNSM) is  inviting authors  to submit  original contributions  in the
area  of network  and  service  management research.  CNSM  2021 is  a
selective  single-track  conference,  covering   all  aspects  of  the
management of  networks and services, pervasive  systems, enterprises,
and cloud computing  environments. The core track  will be accompanied
by a series of workshops and poster sessions.

Papers accepted and  presented at CNSM 2021 will be  published as open
access on  the conference website  (with IFIP copyright), and  will be
submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library.  Authors of selected papers,
accepted for publication in the CNSM 2021 proceedings, will be invited
to submit an extended version of their papers to the IEEE Transactions
on Network and Service Management journal.
