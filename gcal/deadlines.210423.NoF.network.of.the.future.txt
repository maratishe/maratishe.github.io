Call for Papers
NoF 2021

The 12th International Conference on Network of the Future
October 6-8, 2021 – Coimbra, Portugal

http://nof2021.dnac.org
********************************************************************************

The  12th  International Conference on  Network of the Future (NoF) is
inviting
authors to submit original contributions  in the area of Future Internet
design,
with emphasis on enabling and cutting-edge technologies from the
perspectives of
specification,  design and  analysis related to  network of future
architecture,
applications, services, management, implementation, scalability,
standardization,
business and legal  aspects, just to name a few.

The  conference  aims  at  providing  a  forum  for  researchers,
students, and
professionals  to  exchange ideas,  share  their experiences,  and
discuss their
research results  around a single-track  of technical sessions and a
series  of
keynote speeches.

NoF 2021 will take place at the University of Coimbra in Portugal.

The  conference  will  be  designed  and prepared  as a  hybrid event
allowing
registrants the choice to participate either virtually or in-person. In
the case
of perduring traveling restrictions (official or de facto) during the
conference
dates due  to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will  be ready to convert the
conference
to a fully on-line event.
