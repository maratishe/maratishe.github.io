Call for Papers: Special Issue on Security and Privacy Issues of Home
Globalization

In recent years, people have been reshaping their homes into smart homes
by using a wide array of home-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
including inter-connected lights, locks, sensors, actuators, wearables,
and appliances accessible through the Internet and controlled locally
(e.g., via voice) or remotely (e.g., via mobile phone). These smart home
devices are complemented by laptops, mobile phones, game consoles,
electronical health equipment, and many other consumer IoT nodes, which
are constantly used at home for work, pleasure, health, and
entertainment, just to mention the most common purposes. The emerging
pervasiveness of IoT technologies is transforming homes into globalized
homes in which devices supporting everyday activities can be accessed
from anywhere. Although home globalization has its benefits, it also
covertly renders homes more insecure and less private places where
individuals are exposed to more and more varying threats from the
outside world.

Despite the benefits, home globalization and the used technologies have
led to many security threats and privacy breaches. In fact, home-based
IoT technologies at the basis of globalized homes are becoming prone to
abuses including adaptations of well-known cyber-attacks leveraging the
variety of data and devices populating modern apartments and houses. In
addition, both home-based and consumer IoT frameworks collect and manage
information that is tightly coupled with the everyday life of
individuals and can thus be considered a source of sensitive data that
is of interest for profiling or reconnaissance attempts. Therefore, the
resulting home globalization requires us to face new threats and risks
leading to different challenges. In fact, modern homes are
technologically balkanized with services provided via different
technologies (IEEE 802.15.4, home/consumer IoT, voice-based assistants)
and by multiple vendors (device and software) often by using a cloud- or
fog-based scheme. Additional challenges stem from the relatively covert
introduction of new risks during home globalization, as people tend to
put more focus on functionalities of new smart devices than the security
and privacy implications of their use. In this perspective, enforcing
security and privacy in such a scenario requires rethinking and
developing new defenses and solutions, as well as addressing new social
challenges for law enforcement agencies, policy makers, and forensics
professionals.

This special issue aims at collecting the most relevant ongoing research
efforts in the security and privacy field concerning home globalization.
Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Security management of home-based and consumer IoT
- Network security of globalized homes
- Adoption of cybersecurity measures in globalized homes, including
child safety
- Surveillance, interception, blocking, and sovereignty in home-based
IoT environments
- De-anonymization, AI-based social inference, integrity, and privacy leaks
- Stealth communication, information hiding threats, and their detection
in home-based IoT environments
- Cybercrime investigation, law, jurisdiction, and ethics in home-based
IoT environments
