CALL FOR WORKSHOP PAPERS

Validation Trials for 5G-based IoT Solutions Workshop (5GIoTtrials 2021)

in conjunction with
24th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2021)

1 March 2021, Virtual Workshop (https://www.icin-conference.org/workshops/)

==========================================================================

5G rollout has started in many parts of the world and is imminent in others. At the same time, IoT services and applications in vertical areas like industry 4.0, smart grids, eHealth and smart cities which utilize the full capabilities of 5G networks are still emerging. Judging by this demand, massive IoT (mIoT) or massive machine-type communication (mMTC) has been identified as one of the three main communication scenarios for 5G. For enabling and accelerating the large-scale rollout of 5G-based IoT solutions in a wide range of vertical sectors, large-scale validation trials are an important step.

The workshop aims to gather the results of such validation trials for 5G-based IoT solutions in Europe and beyond. In addition to presenting the technological progress and insights gained from these validation trials, the workshop will also foster a multidisciplinary discussion between industry and academia, ICT providers and verticals as well as between the 5G and the IoT research communities. This productive exchange is expected to lead to an identification of existing R&D challenges and new insights on how to address them.

The workshop is organized in cooperation with the 5G EVE, 5G-VINNI, and 5GENESIS projects. The workshop specifically invites papers on relevant validation trials performed by verticals on the large-scale experimental platforms provided (i.e. 5G infrastructure projects of the 5G PPP or other projects or activities). Papers on validation trials for 5G-based IoT solutions performed in other experimental environments are equally welcome.

The topical scope for papers includes, but is not limited to:
• Massive IoT/massive machine-type communication
• Low power wide area (LPWA) technologies such as NB-IoT, etc.
• Standards, and architectures for mIoT over 5G
• Ultra-Reliable, Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)
• mIoT applications over 5G networks applied to verticals industries, e.g. Industry 4.0, healthcare, wearable systems, smart cities, transport & logistics, mobility, agriculture
• Autonomous systems and UAVs
• Security and privacy for mIoT networks
• 5G network slicing for mIoT
• Experimental validation of mIoT applications over 5G networks
• 5G experimentation infrastructures for mIoT
• Massive mIoT data transport optimization and in-network knowledge extraction

Papers submitted to 5GIoTtrials 2021 will be assessed based on originality, technical soundness, clarity and relevance to the workshop topics. All submissions must be written in English and must use standard IEEE two-column conference template, available for download from the IEEE website: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html

Workshop papers can be of up to 6 pages, including tables, figures and references. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process and all submissions must be done electronically through EDAS.
