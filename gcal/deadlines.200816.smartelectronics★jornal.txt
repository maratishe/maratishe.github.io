CALL FOR  PAPERS: IEEE iSES 2020 - EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: AUGUST 16, 2020
6th IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SMART ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
December 14-16, 2020, Chennai, India  (Will Occur in Virtual/Online Mode Due to COVID-19)
(Formerly IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS))
(http://www.ieee-ises.org)
     IEEE iSES is indexed in DBLP https://dblp.org/db/conf/ises/index  
                     “Selected papers from iSES 2020 program will be invited  to special issues of  IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine  and Springer Nature Computer Science Journal”. 
                                               

The primary objective of IEEE-iSES 2020 is to provide a platform for both hardware and software researchers to interact under one umbrella for further development of smart electronic systems. Efficient and secure data sensing, storage, and processing play pivotal roles in current information age. The state-of-the-art smart electronic systems cater to the needs of efficient sensing, storage, and computing. At the same time, efficient algorithms and software used for faster analysis and retrieval of desired information are becoming increasingly important. Big data which are large, complex data sets, are now a part of the Internet world. Storing and processing needs of the enormous amount of structured and unstructured data are getting increasingly challenging. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been evolving with simultaneous development of hardware and software and span across everyday consumer electronics. The performance and efficiency of the present as well as the future generations of computing and information processing systems are largely dependent upon advances in both hardware and software.

iSES 2020 is sponsored by IEEE-CS under TCVLSI. iSES has been initiated as a sponsored meeting of Technical Committee on VLSI, IEEE-CS (http://www.ieee-tcvlsi.org/) that endorses a league of successful meetings such as ASAP, ISVLSI, ARITH, etc., which are now presented as "Sister Conferences" in the iSES website. iSES brings together leading scientists and researchers from academia and industry.

iSES 2020 proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS conference publication services (CPS). Authors are invited to submit full-length (6 pages maximum), original, unpublished research papers with an abstract (200 words maximum). Papers violating length would be excluded from the review process. Previously published papers or papers currently under review for other conferences/journals should not be submitted and will not be considered for publication. Authors should submit their original work of maximum 6 pages using double-column IEEE-CS conference format-template (http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).  Selected papers from iSES 2020 program will be invited  to special issues of  IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine  and Springer Nature Computer Science Journal based on reviewer feedback and quality of conference presentation.
