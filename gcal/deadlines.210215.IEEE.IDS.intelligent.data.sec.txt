Call for Papers
In the current era, intelligent systems are widely deployed and investigated in many domains from the governments to industry players, from academics to consumer-level demand. Therefore, the research on Intelligent data and security (IDS) is getting more and more attention due to the rapid development of computing and communication techniques. As a promising technology, high performance computing is playing an important role not only in traditional computer science domain but also in new branches such as Internet of Things, unmanned vehicles, and topics in artificial intelligence. Smart computing, as another significant aspect, provides solutions for complicated computing problems.

The 6th IEEE International Conference on intelligent data and security (IEEE IDS 2021) is a research event that cooperated with a number of conferences, such as IEEE BigDataSecurity 2021 and IEEE HPSC 2021. This conference provides engineers and scientists in computing domain with an academic forum in which the new research achievements, ideas, and results are shared. The state-of-the-art smart computing applications and experiences in cloud computing and smart computing will be represented in this academic event. IEEE IDS 2021 is the next edition of a series of successful academic events, including IDS 2016 (New York, USA), IDS 2017 (Beijing, China), IDS 2018 (Omaha, USA), IDS 2019 (Washington DC, USA), and IEEE IDS 2020 (Baltimore, USA).

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:

Security in new paradigms of intelligent data
Cyber hacking, next generation fire wall of intelligent data
