Call For Papers

===================

Communication technologies at micro- and nanoscale are essential for tackling numerous challenges in many fields, including ICT, medicine, pharmacology, synthetic biology, and materials science. The interdisciplinary nature of the related research challenges has prompted the creation of new multidisciplinary work groups.



The 8th ACM International Conference on Nanoscale Computing and Communication (ACM NanoCom 2021) aims to further grow the research community that contributes to nanocomputing and communications, and to stimulate the knowledge transfer to industries. In this time and age where lives are impacted by COVID-19, NanoCom also rises as an opportunity to discuss novel ways to model and address this problem from the nanocommunications perspective.



ACM NanoCom 2021 will highlight novel research results and breakthrough ideas, and identify directions for short and medium term exploitation. Novel theoretical and experimental research contributions are welcome. The conference will feature contributed and invited papers, posters, demos and keynote addresses in this emerging inter-disciplinary field.



We invite submissions in areas including (but not limited to) the following:



* Electromagnetic communication at (sub-)THz and optical frequencies

[This includes,

** Coding, modulation, detection, and estimation

** Channel modeling including free-space propagation and intra-chip/intra-body propagation

** Devices based on nanomaterials and metamaterials

** Localization and positioning]



* Molecular communication in the biological, chemical, or mechanical environments

[This includes

** Signal design, detection, estimation, and sensing

** Modeling channels of free diffusion, guided transport, microfluidic, in-vivo/in-vitro biological

** Molecular communication components including signal sources and encoders/decoders]



* Quantum communications in integrated quantum computers

[This includes

** Design and modeling of quantum-coherent interconnects

** Communication theoretic approaches for quantum communications

** Quantum communication protocol design]



* Interfaces for molecular and electromagnetic nanoscale communications



* Nanoscale communication network protocols for nanosensor and biological networks



* Simulation tools and experimental testbeds for nanonetworks

[This includes,

** Design and formal methods for specifying components and parameters

** Experimental demonstration of nano-communication systems]



* Integration of nano- and traditional macroscale communication systems



* Nano-computing paradigms, including neuromorphic computing, DNA and molecular computing, membrane computing, quantum computing, and biological computing



* Applications, such as the Internet of Nano(-Bio)-things, nanosensor networks, systems on chip, nanomedicine, tissue engineering, future and emerging applications, as well as nanonetworks in exotic materials such as functional meta-surfaces and metamaterials.



===================

Call for Posters and Demos

===================

ACM NanoCom 2021 solicits submissions for a poster and demo session dedicated to sharing late-breaking results or work-in-progress on any topic related to nanoscale communication, computing and networks. Posters and demos provide a chance for in-depth research discussions with other conference attendees and are therefore especially well suited for obtaining feedback on ongoing research or controversial ideas. A demo proposal is expected to insist on how the demonstration supports innovative research results or original applications and/or the value for the community of the test platform (please see  the topics of interest above). Demonstrations will be selected based on the expected interest from the Nanocom audience. Poster and demo papers will be presented in an appropriate session.

Submission Guidelines

===================

Regular papers submitted to ACM NanoCom 2021 must be original, not previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere, and they must not be submitted to any other event or publication during the entire review process.

Regular papers are limited to 6 pages including figures and references. They should describe novel advances in topics within the scope of the conference. Authors may submit a 7-page manuscript for review, but an extra page charge of $100 is required for accepted papers.



Poster and demo submissions require an abstract with a maximum length of 2 pages including all figures and references.



All manuscripts must adhere to the guidelines at http://nanocom.acm.org/nanocom2021/cfp.php#submission.



The submitted regular papers, poster, and demo abstracts will undergo a peer review process, as coordinated by the Technical Program Committee.
