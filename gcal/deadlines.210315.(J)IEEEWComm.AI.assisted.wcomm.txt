Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.

Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.

This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:
