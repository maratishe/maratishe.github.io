***CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS***

https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/cf-tutorials.html



+ Deadline for proposals – April 9, 2021

+ Notification of acceptance – April 30, 2021



We seek to extend the SIGCOMM experience by tutorials on selected topics given by renowned scientists and practitioners in their fields. We therefore solicit proposals for full-day or half-day tutorials on topics relevant to the SIGCOMM community. Keep in mind that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SIGCOMM 2021 will be held fully online.



Tutorials must cover advanced topics that fit the scope of SIGCOMM and are of current interest to the SIGCOMM community.  Tutorials may be lectures, interactive workshops, hands-on training, or any combination of the above. Successful tutorials educate the community members on emerging methods, concepts, and tools to expand the research capabilities of the community. Cross-disciplinary topics are also welcome.  Exploring diverse ways of organizing the content, delivering the tutorial, and interacting with the audience in an online format are especially encouraged.





***WHERE TO SUBMIT***



Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, should not exceed three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the Tutorial Chairs by email to chenyang@fudan.edu.cn and retvari@tmit.bme.hu, with the subject “[SIGCOMM 2021] Tutorial Proposal”.





**WHAT TO SUBMIT?***



- A motivation for the tutorial (why this, why now, why at SIGCOMM?)



- An outline of the tutorial content, including its tentative schedule (over a half-day or full-day)



- The type of tutorial (e.g., lecture vs. hands-on). It is highly recommended that full-day tutorials should include a hands-on component and not be limited to only lectures. Hands-on components are well-known to be more engaging and pedagogically better in teaching for full-day events.



- References to previous iterations of the tutorial (if applicable) including their date, venue, topics and number of participants and the motivation for the new proposal.



- Special requirements for the online tutorial (please note that our capabilities in fulfilling unusual requests are limited). A Zoom and a dedicated Slack channel will be provided.



- Requirements for the attendees (e.g., must have their own laptop or other hardware, familiarity with certain technologies or topics, speed of Internet connection, artifacts to download beforehand, etc.)



- A clear indication whether or not the tutorial artifacts (slides, video, notebooks, containers/VMs, etc.) are allowed to be posted publicly at the conference website.





***IMPORTANT NOTES***



- Each tutorial will be scheduled at a particular time slot on Monday and/or Friday on the week of the main SIGCOMM conference, possibly in parallel with the workshops. This is to foster interaction with the audience. Purely offline tutorials with pre-recorded video and no online delivery are not acceptable.



- Preference in the acceptance decision process will be given to tutorial submissions that (1) provide hands-on experience to the attendees, (2) strive to exploit the opportunities provided by the online format (i.e., use Jupyter notebooks for hands-on material, offer preinstalled VMs/containers, etc.), and (3) build on open content that can be freely posted on the conference website.



- It is recommended that there are up to three speakers for a full-day tutorial and up to two speakers for a half-day tutorial. It is a good idea to have another person available to feed the interactive questions from Slack channel to the presenters online.



- Upon acceptance of a tutorial proposal, either the tutorial co-chair or the tutorial speakers can request a cancellation of the tutorial if there is clear evidence indicating low attendance of the tutorial by the early registration deadline.



- Compensation to tutorial speakers will not be provided.
