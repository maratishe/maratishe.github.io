High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to
continuously support
the worldâ€™s most important discoveries in various scientific and
business domains such
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and
financial
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A
number of
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in
the time
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are
developing
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,
and methods that
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.

Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate
predictive
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum
advances in
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific
community. New
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have
also been
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many
problems that
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and
engineering. Training
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing
intensive task that
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era
will be the
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep
learning based
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart
manufacturing,
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.

While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,
renovation in
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance
delivery. The exascale
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI
continue to
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based
system,
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching
towards
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can
seamlessly
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute
resources. We
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and
techniques, performance
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of
application-level
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and
low-level software
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of
exascale in many contexts.
