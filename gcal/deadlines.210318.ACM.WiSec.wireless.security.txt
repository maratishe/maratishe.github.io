Call for Papers: 14th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless
and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec 2021)
========================================================================

The 14th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile
Networks (ACM WiSec 2021) will be held virtually from June 28 to July 1,
2021.

ACM WiSec is the leading ACM and SIGSAC conference dedicated to all
aspects of security and privacy in wireless and mobile networks and
their applications. In addition to the traditional ACM WiSec topics of
physical, link, and network layer security, we welcome papers focusing
on the increasingly diverse range of mobile or wireless applications
such as Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, as well as the
security and privacy of mobile software platforms, usable security and
privacy, biometrics, and cryptography.

The conference welcomes both theoretical as well as systems
contributions. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

- Cryptographic primitives for wireless and mobile security
- Data-driven security attacks and countermeasures
- Economics of mobile security and privacy
- Jamming attacks and defenses
- Key management (agreement or distribution) for wireless or mobile
systems
- Lightweight cryptography primitives and protocols
- Mobile malware and platform security
- NFC and smart payment applications
- Next generation cellular network fraud and security
- Physical tracking security and privacy
- Resilience and dependability for mobile and wireless networks
- Reverse engineering of and tampering with mobile applications
- Security and privacy for cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access
systems
- Security and privacy for mobile applications (e.g., mobile sensing
systems)
- Security and privacy for smart devices (e.g., smartphones)
- Secure localization and location privacy
- Security protocols for wireless networking
- Side-channel and fault attacks on smart devices
- Side-channel attacks on mobile and wearable systems
- Theoretical and formal approaches for wireless and mobile security
- Usable mobile security and privacy
- Vehicular networks security (e.g., drones, automotive, avionics,
autonomous driving)
- Wireless and mobile privacy and anonymization techniques
- Wireless or mobile security for cyber-physical systems (e.g,
healthcare, smart grid) and IoT systems
- Wireless network security for critical infrastructures

The proceedings of ACM WiSec, sponsored by SIGSAC, will be published by
the ACM.


Important dates
===============

- Paper submission deadline: March 18, 2021 (23:59 AoE)
- Author notification: April 29, 2021
- Camera-ready deadline: May 21, 2021 (23:59 AoE)
- WiSec conference: June 28 to July 1, 2021


Full and short papers
=====================

Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2021 can be up to 10 pages in the
ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked
appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the
submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including
bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more
succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available
on the WiSec 2021 website at https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.

For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by
the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and
included in the proceedings.


Posters and demos
=================

WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.


Replicability label
===================

WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to
minimize the overhead of applying for this label.
The process of reviewing the work for replicability will be largely
similar to the previous years.


Double submissions
==================

It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals
involved.


Workshops and Tutorial
==================
ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorial co-organized with the main
conference. Details will be made available on the website.
