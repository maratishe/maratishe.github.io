Scope

**********************

Wireless ad hoc, sensor, along with ubiquitous networks have recently witnessed their fastest growth period ever in history, and this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. However, as such networks become increasingly complex, performance modelling and evaluation will play a crucial part in their design process to ensure their successful deployment and exploitation in practice.

This symposium will bring together scientists, engineers, and practitioners to share and exchange their experiences, discuss challenges, and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on all aspects of wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks with a specific emphasis on their performance evaluation and analysis.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

· Predictive performance models of ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks.

· Probabilistic models for ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks.

· Queuing and network information theoretic analysis

· Analytical modeling and simulation methods

· Automatic performance analysis

· Tracing and trace analysis

· Software tools for network performance and evaluation

· Performance measurement, evaluation and monitoring tools for ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks

· Case studies demonstrating the role of performance evaluation in the design of ad hoc, sensor and ubiquitous networks

· Network performance improvement through optimization and tuning

· Mobility modeling and management

· Traffic models for ad hoc, sensor networks

· Performance evaluation of wireless mesh networks

· Performance evaluation of pervasive and ubiquitous networks

· Performance evaluation of VANETs

· Performance of wireless and sensor devices

· Performance of spectrum agile and cognitive wireless sensor networks

· Analysis of multimedia applications over wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks

· Performance of pervasive computing and services

· Analysis of mobile cloud networking and computing

· Performance of continuity of service over heterogeneous networks, seamless connectivity

· Analysis of security and privacy in ad hoc networks and ubiquitous networks

· Simulation methods, performance and analysis

· Real experimentation, deployments, open platforms
