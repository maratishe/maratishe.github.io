Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation.  The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.

This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:

Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling
Medium access control design
Data centers and cloud systems
Radio access technology selection
Spectrum sharing in intra- and inter-tier HetNets
Traffic load estimation and resource reservation
User mobility prediction and handover support
Network fault detection and self-healing
Network self-configuration and self-organization
Intrusion detection and self-protection
Machine learning relevant topics
Relevant analysis and modelling
Relevant surveys

Submission Procedure
Submitted papers must represent original material which is not currently under review in any other conference or journal and has not been previously published. Paper length should not exceed six-page standard IEEE conference two-column format (including all text, figures, and references). Full details of submission procedures and requirements for authors of accepted papers are available at https://icc2021.ieee-icc.org/. All submitted papers will go through a peer review process. All accepted and presented papers will be included in the IEEE ICC 2021 proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore. IEEE reserves the right to exclude an accepted and registered but not presented paper from the IEEE digital library.
