                       Call for Papers:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first issue of "Software: Practice and Experience", published in
1971, reported on applications that could be described in a few thousand
lines of code; today, software systems are among the most complex
entities produced by humans. This growth has spawned new development
methodologies and exposed serious systemic weaknesses.

Over the last 50 years, our most pressing problems have moved from the
seven development issues that David Barron focused on in his inaugural
editorial to issues brought about by the scope and ubiquity of our
current applications: Software systems must now be resistant to attack
by malicious agents, and must operate successfully with improper inputs.
  Cyber-physical systems must avoid entering states that would damage
equipment or harm people.  Applications built as a collection of
cooperating processes must be able to deliver results in a timely
manner, even when the number of simultaneous users fluctuates
significantly.  Whether or not these issues can be dealt with by current
design methodology is an open question.  Regardless of the answer,
however, Barron's vision for the journal as a venue for authors to
present their work in a form that will be useful to others remains valid
as we move into the next 50 years.

We invite high quality papers that discuss the development of new ideas,
models, paradigms, and systems evolution appropriate to the challenges
facing the field today.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
   * Threat models for software systems
   * Performance improvement in distributed systems
   * Scalability of software
   * User interface design
   * Workflow management
   * Application Programming Models and Environments
   * Advances in systems software powering embedded devices to
     large-scale computing environments
   * Internet-driven Innovative Applications

Submissions Due: October 31, 2020 * (early submission is
                  highly encouraged)
Notification: Nov 30, 2020

Publication Date: 1st issue of 2021 (expected).




Special Issue Paper Submission:
*******************************

This special issue seeks submission of papers that present “Software
Systems and Innovations Journey from 1970-2020”. All submissions
including invited papers go under regular peer review process. Priority
will be given to papers that present new and original works for the
"first" time in SPE. Submission of "extended versions" of already
published works (e.g., conference papers) is not encouraged unless they
contain a significant number of "new and original" ideas/contributions
along with more than 50% brand "new" material. If you are submitting an
extended version, you must submit a cover letter/document detailing (1)
the "Summary of Differences" between the SPE paper and the earlier
paper, (2) a clear list of "new and original" ideas/contributions in the
SPE paper (identifying sections where they are presented), and (3)
confirming the percentage of new material. Otherwise, the submission
will be "desk" rejected without being reviewed.
While submitting paper to this issue, please select “SPE-SI-50Years
Software Systems and Innovations” in the submission system.
