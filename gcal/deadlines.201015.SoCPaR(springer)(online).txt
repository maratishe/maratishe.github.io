12th International Conference on Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR 2020) December 15-18, 2020, online

Web Economy refers to an economy that is based on digital computing technologies. It is also referred to as the Internet Economy, New Economy, or Digital Economy. It results from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, intelligent devices (IoT), data, and processes.  The amount of available data grows exponentially and traditional data analysis techniques are unsuitable to extract useful information from such vast amounts of data; thus, intelligent data analysis methods combining human expertise and computational models for accurate and in-depth data analysis are necessary. Computational intelligence (CI) methods such as fuzzy models, artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and probabilistic methods have recently emerged as promising tools for the development and application of intelligent systems for Web Economy. CI-based systems can learn from data and evolve according to changes in the environments by taking into account the uncertainty characterizing health data and processes. The use of CI for Web Economy can improve the management of economic and behavioral data by introducing intelligent solutions for prediction, network analysis, anomaly detection, opinion mining, as well for analysis of administrative processes.


This Special Session will publish original research, overviews, and applications of CI methods for Web Economy. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following:


Fuzzy logic and fuzzy models for  Web Economy

Evolutionary computing for  Web Economy

Artificial neural networks for  Web Economy

Fuzzy time series for Web Economy

Probabilistic models for  Web Economy

Big data analytics for Web Economy

Stream Data Mining for Web Economy

Data mining for  Web Economy

Pattern recognition for  Web Economy

Fuzzy linguistic descriptions for  Web Economy

Blockchain for Web Economy

Applications (Anomaly Detection, Credit Card Fraud Detection, Stock Price Prediction, Mobile Social commerce, E-Banking Failure, Customer Behavior analysis, Sentiment analysis, Micropayment Systems, etc.)
