Call for Papers

Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) Conference 2021

https://www.pam2021.b-tu.de


The Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) conference brings together
researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area
of network measurement and analysis. PAM is inclusive of all areas of
network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and
real-world data. Indeed, measurement technology is needed at all layers
of the network stack, ranging from power profiling of hardware
components to virtualization in data centers to application profiling
and even user experience. Work with operational impact or relevance to
the broader network research community is especially welcome, as is
early and promising measurement technique. Original contributions that
advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas are invited:

- Applications (e.g., web, streaming, games)
- Data centers and cloud computing
- Energy
- IoT (e.g., smart home, SCADA, ICS, embedded systems)
- Measurement tools and software
- Network security and privacy
- Overlays (e.g., P2P, CDNs)
- Physical Layer
- Routing
- Social networks
- Topology
- Transport/congestion control
- User behavior and experience, QoE
- Virtualization (e.g., SDN, NFV)
- Visualization
- Wireless and mobile

Although PAM traditionally attracts early stage contributions, works
that are a reappraisal or independent validation of previous results, or
which enhance the reproducibility of network measurement research, for
instance by publishing new datasets on an existing topic, are explicitly
included in PAM's scope. Thus, in addition to full research papers as
described above, PAM also invites submission in the following two
categories:

PAM 2021 will be held virtually.


*Important Dates*

- *Paper Registration* October 16th, 2020 | 23:59 EDT
- *Paper Submission* October 23rd, 2020 | 23:59 EDT
- *Notification to Authors* December 18th, 2020
- *Camera-ready Due* February 5th, 2021
- *Virtual Conference* Late March / early April - to be announced


*Submission Guidelines*

Authors should only submit original work that has not been published
before and is not under submission to any other venue. All submissions
must satisfy the following requirements:

- Follow Springer LNCS format (see
https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)
- Up to 12 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and
references)
- Note that reviewers are not required to read appendices.
Everything needed to evaluate the paper should appear in the first 12 pages.
- Anonymization: Reviewing will be double-blind:
- Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission.
- Refer to your prior work in the third person.
- Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would give you away.
- If you have any concerns about how to anonymize your paper while
maintaining its integrity, contact the PC chairs.
- Submit via HotCRP: https://hotcrp.cs.umd.edu/pam2021/


*Ethical Considerations*

Following the standard set by the Internet Measurement Conference (from
which we base this section), papers describing experiments with users or
sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network
information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and
subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure
storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are
placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential,
beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society
while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation. When
appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection (in the main
paper, not in the Appendix) describing these issues. Authors may want to
consult the Menlo Report
(http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/)
for further information on ethical principles and the Allman/Paxson IMC
2007 paper (https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf)
for guidance on ethical data sharing. Note that submitting research for
approval by each author's institutional ethics review body is necessary,
but not sufficient -- in cases where the PC has concerns about the
ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical
soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical
soundness. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact
the program committee co-chairs.

*Awards*

There will be two awards for papers of exceptional merit. The **Best
Paper Award** will recognize the paper that is deemed by the committee
to have the highest merit of all the submissions. The *Best Dataset
Award* will be given to the best paper that makes datasets and
corresponding code available to the public by the time the camera-ready
is submitted. These artifacts must be sufficiently documented such that
any researcher can use them to repeat the results described in the
paper, and they must be placed in a sufficiently long-lived archival
repository (e.g., Github, Bitbucket, or CRAWDAD).

*Organizers*

- General Chair: Oliver Hohlfeld (Brandenburg University of Technology)

- Program Committee Chairs: Andra Lutu (Telef√≥nica) and Dave Levin
(University of Maryland)
