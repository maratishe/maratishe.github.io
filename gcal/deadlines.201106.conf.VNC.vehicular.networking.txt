The IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC) is the premiere conference on vehicular networks and applications. It brings together researchers, professionals, and practitioners to share the latest results and to brainstorm the next phases of exploration in the foundations, technologies, and applications of vehicular communication networks. The 2020 VNC will be held virtually between December 16-18, 2020.

* Architectures and system designs for connected, automated driving
* Edge computing and cloud
* Security, privacy, liability, and dependability of vehicular networks
* Integration of V2C with on-board systems and networks

Tools & Methods

* Hardware and software platforms for the simulation, emulation, prototyping, measurement, and/or real-world deployment of vehicular networks and applications
* Field measurements and/or real-world deployments of vehicular networks and applications
* Modeling, design, and analysis of vehicular networks and applications

Connected & Automated Driving and Other Applications

* Cooperative perception and cooperative driving

Manuscript submissions
************
The submitted papers must be written in English and be formatted in the standard IEEE two-column format and with a font size no less than 10-point. The mandatory IEEE template in Microsoft Word and LaTeX format can be found at the IEEE templates page. Only Adobe PDF files will be accepted for the review process. All submissions must be made electronically through EDAS. Details will be available at the conference webpage http://www.ieee-vnc.org/ soon.

The conference will consider four categories of submissions:
? Full papers should describe novel research contributions and are limited in length to eight (8) printed pages including figures, tables, and references. Papers exceeding 8 pages will be declined automatically and will not be reviewed.
? Short papers should be more visionary in nature and may report on work-in-progress without fully finished results. They are meant to present novel perspectives, so as to foster discussions about innovative directions and new points of view. They are limited to at most four (4) pages including figures, tables, and references, but might in many cases be even shorter. Accepted short papers will be included in the proceedings and will be given (a shorter) time for oral presentation at the conference.
? Posters are especially suited for presenting controversial research directions that may generate discussion, or promising ideas not yet fully validated through complete extensive evaluation.
? Demonstration (demo) papers are suited for researchers to showcase their latest prototypes with media, models, or live demonstrations. The demo session will be co-located with the poster session to ensure maximum visibility and a close interaction with the conference audience.
Poster/demo papers should be 2-page papers following standard IEEE 2-column format using 10-point font. All paper submissions must be written in English. The title of the paper should begin with either "Poster:" or "Demo:‚Äù.
