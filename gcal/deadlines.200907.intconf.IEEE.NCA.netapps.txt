19th IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA 2020)

Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society - Technical Committee on Distributed Processing

Virtual Conference due to COVID-19  --  26-28 November 2020

*CALL FOR PAPERS*

NCA is a successful series of conferences that serves as a large international forum for presenting and sharing recent research
results and technological developments in the fields of Network and Cloud Computing. NCA, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society, reaches out to both researchers and practitioners, and to both academia and industry. The conference features keynotes,
technical presentations, and workshops.

The IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA) is seeking articles concerning fundamental research
and practical experience reports.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Theory of Network Computing
- Autonomic Network Computing
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- High Speed Networks/Protocols and Middleware
- Routing Mechanisms
- Overlay Networks/Peer-to-Peer Systems
- System Area Networks (SAN)/Clusters
- Performance Modeling/Quality of Services (QoS) Issues
- Web Caching and Switching
- Dependable Wide, Local, and System Area Networks
- Network Security
- Intrusion-Tolerant Networked Systems
- Scalable and Dependable Servers and Data Centers
- Middleware for Dependable Network Computing
- Self* (Configuring, Healing, Optimizing, Protecting, Organizing, Aware)
- Platforms for Network Computing
- Network Protocols: Verification and Validation
- Autonomic Network Computing for Achieving Self* Properties and Applications Availability
- Seamless and Virtual Capabilities for Implementing Self* Properties
- Software Defined Networking (SDN): Principles and Implementation
- Designing Highly-Available and Secure SDN
- Network Functions Virtualization (NFV): Design and Optimization
- Network Cloud Computing
- Machine Learning Techniques for Cloud Resources Management
- Big Data in Clouds for IoT
- Future Internet and Communicating Objects
- Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET)
- Sensor Networks
- Fog/Edge Computing
- Energy-Efficient Computation and Communication
- Applications to Real and/or Complex Problems, Practical Experiences and Prototypes
- Programming Environments for Distributed Systems
- Blockchain
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Web and Mobile Security
- Solutions Relevant to the COVID-19 Pandemic


*IMPORTANT DATES*

*MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSIONS*

Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. Please visit the submission link to send your manuscript:
http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2020
(The submission site will open soon)

Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere and must be
cleared for publication in the NCA Proceedings, which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. The manuscript
must be written in English, and must not exceed 8 pages for NCA papers or 4 pages for workshop papers. Following last year's
success, NCA also invites manuscripts presenting Work-in-Progress (WiP), which must not exceed 3 pages. More details about
the WiP track can be found in the NCA website. All submissions must be in PDF format.


Manuscript page limit:

Regular Papers: 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
Short Papers: 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
WiP Papers: 3 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.


Purchasing extra pages:

Regular Papers: Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at $100 (US dollars) per extra page.
Short Papers: Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at $100 (US dollars).

Authors can decide to submit papers longer than 8/4 pages (up to 10 and 5, depending on the category) before the reviewing
process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore, longer
papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions, in case of acceptance. This is to respect the work made by
reviewers and other authors who decided to stay in the limits.


*ACCEPTED PAPERS AND PUBLICATION POLICIES*

Every paper accepted at NCA must have attached to it at least one registration at the full (member or non-member) rate. Thus,
for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration
rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation for up to
two (2) papers.

No-show papers are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper at the technical meeting.
This year, due to COVID-19, NCA will be a fully virtual conference, with no travel involved. All presentations will be given
via pre-recorded videos, followed by synchronized online discussions during the conference period. For an accepted paper to not
be considered as "no-show", at least one of its authors will have to prepare a video presentation and provide it to the organizers
who will make it available to the participants of the conference. Moreover, at least one author of the accepted paper will have
to participate to the online discussions that are relevant to their paper. Instructions for these will be provided at the NCA
website.

Presentations by proxies are not allowed, unless explicitly approved *before* the conference by the technical co-chairs. No-show
papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings must be identified as "No-Show" in the files submitted to IEEE
for further publication (IEEE Xplore). No-shows will not be available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE will
maintain an archive of no-shows.

The IEEE strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program.

If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE policy dictates that the
request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE policy also states that in this case,
the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the
expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in
this regard.


*BEST PAPER AWARDS*

The IEEE NCA 2020 Program Committee will select Best Paper and Best Student Paper. The first author of the Best Student Paper must
be a PhD student.
