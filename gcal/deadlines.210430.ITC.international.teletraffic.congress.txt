The International Teletraffic Congress ITC 33, is the 33th edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking
science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks
in a holistic way. Since then, it has established a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and discussing the
latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.

ITC 33 focuses on the future networks taking advantage of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), towards “AI-integrated Networks”.
Indeed, service providers from all over the world are already reaping the benefits of integrating AI into their networks. For ITC 33,
cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering
and control with application also to emerging softwarized/virtualized network paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenarios brought
about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. We especially encourage original contributions which bridge the gap between
performance modeling and real-life operational aspects, including works which leverage measurement data to provide a better
understanding of the wired and wireless networks operation under realistic conditions.

ITC 33 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and
performance evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. ITC 33 is structured into eight different areas. The
objectives in these areas include, among others, energy-efficiency and green IT, network security and privacy, QoS and QoE,
and resilience. The technical sessions will be structured around, but are not limited to, the following topics:

• Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization
• Network Measurements and Big Data
• Networking Architectures and Paradigms
• Wireless and Cellular Networks
• Data Center Networking for Cloud Computing Design and Operation
• Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization
• Networking for Edge and Fog Computing
• Network Economics

The conference will feature a best paper award and a best student paper award. Papers receiving best paper awards of the
conference will be invited for fast-track reviews by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering.

Besides the general submissions, ITC33 encourages submissions for the *Ph.D. workshop* and special sessions.

Important dates:

**Friday April 30, 2021: Paper submission deadline (firm)**
Monday June 14, 2021: Expected notification date
Monday July 5, 2021: Camera-ready deadline
Tuesday August 31 - Friday September 3, 2021: Conference dates

For detailed information and deadlines, please check the website.

**NOTE: ITC 33 2021 will go virtual.** The 33 Edition of International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) is taking place at the end of
Summer 2021, and it is impossible to predict the situation in terms of the pandemic. Under the current circumstances of the
COVID-19 pandemic, global traveling and meeting have been heavily restricted and difficult. Hence, ITC 33 will resort to
virtual conference attendance.
