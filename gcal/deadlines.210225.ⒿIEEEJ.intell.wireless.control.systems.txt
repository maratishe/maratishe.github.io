Theme: Nowadays billions of smart objects are connected to the internet and interact with the cloud. Remote monitoring, control systems and data analysis becomes more intelligent with the huge amount of data been collecting and crowdsourcing. However, the great convenience raises numerous issues including reliability and security of the sensors and the control systems because these issues has not always been considered top priority. Accordingly, many new research opportunities and challenges for intelligent sensing and control have arisen. This special section aims at addressing significant issues in the field of smart sensors, communication networks, Internet of Things and wireless communications. This special section will focus on (but not limited to) the following topics:

l  Advanced approaches for smart sensors and data processing and storage

l  Security and dependability for communication networks

l  Remote sensing and applications for Internet of Things

l  Intelligent, robust and secure control of wireless communications



Timetable: Deadline for manuscript submissions February 25, 2021

Expected publication date (tentative) October 2021
