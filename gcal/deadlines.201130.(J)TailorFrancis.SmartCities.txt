*Submission Deadline: 30 November 2020*

Smart city is the culmination of applying cutting-edge cyber-physical concepts to city resource management scenarios such as water supply, energy distribution, transportation management and public safety to streamline them for higher operational efficiencies. This is made possible by the tremendous recent advancement in technologies such as cloud computing, computer networking, and Internet of Things. In smart city deployments, sensors and actuators that generate and consume massive volumes of data under diverse formats and ontologies will be integrated into the overall system. The data created by the participating devices need to be appropriately classified and related so that duplication and conflicts can be minimized. To handle the massive volumes of data in a timely manner and to prevent overloads in the cloud infrastructure, newer edge computing paradigms need to be developed.

This special issue mainly focuses on software services and cyber infrastructure of smart cities, addressing both original algorithmic development and new applications. We are soliciting original contributions, of leading researchers and practitioners from academia as well as industry, which address a wide range of theoretical and application issues in this domain.

The topics relevant to this special issue include but are not limited to:
- Enabling wireless communication technologies for smart cities
- High-speed networking infrastructure for smart cities
- Cloud computing infrastructure for smart cities
- Edge computing for smart cities
- Sensing and Internet of Things infrastructure for smart cities
- Energy aware or low energy systems and technologies
- Low maintenance embedded systems and networks
- QoS of smart city systems, applications, and services
- Service innovation and design to support smart cities
- Management, configuration and deployment of smart city infrastructure
- Application, deployment, test-bed, and experiences in smart cities
- Big data acquisition, preprocessing, data storage and management for urban informatics
- Data privacy, security, and trust issues in smart cities
- Smart data for social entrepreneurship and community engagement
- Sharing economy in smart cities
- Mobile crowdsourcing for urban analytics

Submission
