Call for Papers

Special Issue on Intelligent Recommendation System and Big Data Analysis

 

Big Data Mining and Analytics is an international academic journal sponsored by Tsinghua University and published quarterly. It features on technologies to enable and accelerate big data discovery. All papers published are on the IEEE Xplore Digital Library with the open access mode. The journal is indexed and abstracted in DBLP Computer Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus (Elsevier).

Big data comes from many applications such as social media, sensors, Internet of Things, scientific applications, surveillance, video and image archives. As part of Big Data, intelligent recommendation systems and big data analytics are rapidly evolving as new research fields which have become a key tool for the development of human activities, especially in the Healthcare sector.

The goal of the Special Issue "Intelligent Recommendation Systems and Big Data Analysis" is to provide an international forum for scientists, engineers, and managers in academia, industry, and government to address recent research results and to present and discuss their ideas, theories, models, technologies, systems, tools, applications, work in progress and experiences, dealing with all theoretical and practical aspects on “intelligent recommendation systems and big data analysis” when applied in different sectors : Healthcare, Education, Utilities, Tourism, Telecommunication, Transport , Finance, ...etc.

A special attention will be paid to works that focus on health informatics solutions for early chronic disease (e.g., COVID-19) prediction, detection and prevention.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

·         Big Data Modeling, Storage, Management, And Analytics

·         Big Data Intelligence

·         Big Data and Data Science

·         Temporal, Evolution and Versioning Aspects of Big Data

·         NoSQL Databases and Big Data

·         Intelligent Recommendation Systems

·         Clinical Data and Knowledge Management

·         Data mining Techniques and Data Warehouses

·         Innovative collaboration applications in big data environment 

·         Security, Trust and Risk in Big Data

·          Intelligence Artificial and machine learning

·         Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing

·          Cloud and grid computing for Big Data
