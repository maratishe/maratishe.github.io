Aims and Scope

Social network (SN) is a social structure and it is the combination of networks and graph theory. A SN contains two major parameters, viz. nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the edges, ties or links (interactions  or relationships) that connect nodes. In SNs, social structures are visualized, e.g. friendship and acquaintance networks, social media networks, business networks, information circulation, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, disease transmission,  collaboration graphs, kinship, sexual relationships, etc. These networks are sometimes visualized using sociograms  where nodes are represented by points and edges are represented by lines. Now-a-days a huge amount of people are using SN throughout the globe and hence social network analysis becomes an important issue and it is a key technique in modern sociology. The mobile and Internet technologies have been the primary force behind the rise of social media, providing technological platforms for information dissemination,  interactive communications, content generation etc.

Analysis of SN is used extensively in a wide range of applications and disciplines, e.g.   data aggregation and mining, network propagation modeling, network modeling and sampling, user attribute and behavior analysis, community-maintained resource support, location-based interaction analysis, social sharing and filtering, recommender systems development, and link prediction and entity resolution, businesses use social network analysis to support activities such as customer interaction and analysis, information system development analysis, marketing, and business intelligence needs,  development of leader engagement strategies, analysis of individual and group engagement and media use,  community-based problem solving and many more.

Today, consumers constantly interact with social media. Companies are very eager to take advantage of our constant engagement with platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. As a result, a growing number are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in social media to better connect with potential customers. Just a single click can impact what notifications pop up on our social media accounts, viz. posts, advertisements, friend suggestions, and more due to the use of AI.



This special issue focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to develop and manage SN. The aim of this special issue is provide a forum in which to publish state-of-the-art articles for development, security, management, etc. of SN.
