Dear colleagues,

Apologies in advance for any cross-posting!

This year, there are two workshops co-located with CNSM 2020.

— International Workshop on Analytics for Service and Application Management

— International Workshop on the Future Evolution of Internet Protocols

The deadline for paper submission to workshops is: September 10, 2020.

Authors will present their work virtually to ensure both the safety of participants and wide dissemination. Thus, the registration rates will be very low.

Please consider submitting. More information is available at: http://www.cnsm-conf.org/2020/workshops.html

Kind regards,
Nur Zincir-Heywood, Mehmet Ulema, Muge Sayit, Stuart Clayman
