Dear Colleagues,


I hope this email finds you well. As a member of the Editorial Board for JSAN, I am writing to notify you about our latest Special Issue, “State-of-the-Art in Sensor and Actuator Networks: Current Status and Future Possibilities”, created by myself and four other editors. We would like to invite you to collaborate with us by promoting this project.


This Special Issue of JSAN is intended to solicit novel research papers on the current state-of-the-art and future directions of WSAN, aiming to provide a comprehensive view of this field of research. For this Special Issue, we will only accept high-quality submissions from our EB members or high-profile researchers recommended by them. All authors will benefit from low publication fees (0%-30% of full charge). We would like to invite you to recommend three or more high-profile researchers or colleagues to submit high-quality survey or research papers to JSAN for this Special Issue.


The submission deadline is 30 June 2021. More detailed information can be found at
