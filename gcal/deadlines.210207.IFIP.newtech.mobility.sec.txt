NTMS'2021 is the 11th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security that will be held from 19 to 21 April 2021 in Paris, France.

NTMS'2021 aims at fostering advances in the areas of New Technologies, Wireless Networks, Mobile Computing, Ad hoc and Ambient Networks, QoS, Network Security and E-commerce, to mention a few, and provides a dynamic forum for researchers, students and professionals to present their state-of-the-art research and development in these interesting areas.

The event will be combined with tutorial sessions and workshops. Tutorials will precede the main program, aiming at the dissemination of mature knowledge and technology advances in the field. Two or more Workshops will immediately follow the main conference, offering the opportunity for a more focused exchange of ideas and presentation of on-going research relevant to following tracks (More information and the full call-for-papers can be found on the conference web):
