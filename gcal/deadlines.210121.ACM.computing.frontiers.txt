ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers 2021 (CF'21)
May 11th - 13th, 2021, Virtual Conference

CALL FOR PAPERS
Deadline: January 28th, 2021

http://www.computingfrontiers.org/
======================================================================


The next ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers will
take place on May 11th - 13th, 2021. Due to the current state of the
pandemic and the uncertainty of how it will evolve in the coming
months, Computer Frontiers 2021 will be held as a virtual conference
instead of a face-to-face event in the town of Catania, in Sicily
(Italy) as it was initially planned.

Computing Frontiers is an eclectic, interdisciplinary, collaborative
community of researchers who investigate emerging technologies in the
broad field of computing: our common goal is to drive the scientific
breakthroughs that support society.

CF's broad scope is driven by recent technological advances in
wide-ranging fields impacting computing, such as novel computing
models and paradigms, advancements in hardware, network and
systems architecture, cloud computing, novel device physics and
materials, new application domains of artificial intelligence, big
data analytics, wearables and IoT. The boundaries between the
state-of-the-art and revolutionary innovation constitute the
advancing frontiers of science, engineering, and information
technology - and are the CF community focus. CF provides a venue to
share, discuss, and advance broad, forward-thinking, early research
on the future of computing and welcomes work on a wide spectrum of
computer systems, from embedded and hand-held/wearable devices to
supercomputers and datacenters.

We strongly encourage submissions in emerging fields that may not fit
into traditional categories - if in doubt, please contact the PC
co-chairs by email: Carmen G. Almudever (C.GarciaAlmudever-1 (AT)

CONFERENCE WEBSITE
==================

SUBMISSION
==========

We encourage the submission of both full and short papers containing
high-quality research describing original and unpublished work.

Papers must be submitted through

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cf21

Short papers may be position papers or may describe preliminary or
highly speculative work. Full papers are a maximum of eight (8)
(excluding references) and short papers are a maximum of four (4)
(including references) double-column pages in ACM conference format
(https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Authors may
buy up to two (2) extra pages for accepted full papers. Page limits
include figures, tables and appendices, but exclude references for
full papers. As the review process is double-blind, removal of all
identifying information from paper submissions is required (i.e., cite
own work in third person). Papers not conforming to the above
submission policies on formatting, page limits and the removal of
identifying information will be automatically rejected. Authors are
strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of
authors, as changes may not be feasible at later stages.

No-show policy: Any accepted papers are expected to be presented at
the conference and at least one full registration is required from
a submission author for each accepted paper. A no-show of papers will
result in exclusion from the ACM digital library proceedings. If
circumstances arise such that authors are unable to present their
papers at the conference, they must contact the PC co-chairs.


SUBMISSION FORMAT
=================

Stage 1 - Abstract submission: A title, abstract (approx. 100 words), and
a list of all co-authors must be submitted by January 21st, 2021. You may
also submit the paper at this time.

Stage 2 - Paper submission: The short or full papers must be submitted by
January 28th, 2021.
