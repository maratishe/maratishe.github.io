Dear Friends and Colleagues:
      The 16th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2020) has been a premier venue for presenting scholarly research on mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks. Advances in this field are leading to innovative platforms, protocols, systems, and applications for the next-generation mobile networks, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems. From this year, the conference name is changed to Mobility, Sensing and Networking to cover the recent advancement in mobile and wireless technologies. With its 16th anniversary, MSN 2020 will be held at Tokyo, Japan.
     In addition to the papers, keynotes, and posters, the MSN 2020 program will include 6 workshops (listed below) to present preliminary and cutting edge work on new directions that advance the field of Mobility, Sensing and Networking. The workshop papers are published in the conference proceedings and included in IEEE Xplore digital library.
