Conferences Pivoting to a Part-Virtual Platform

[IEEE BigDataSE 2020] – Now Taking Place Part-Virtually

The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. After evaluating the current COVID-19 situation, the decision has been made to transform the in-person component of the conference into a part-digital conference experience – the conference will now be a combination of online and offline event. Therefore, the conference will take place partly in Guangzhou, China and will also take place part-virtually. The conference dates remain the same – December 29, 2020 - January 1, 2021. Proceedings will not be cancelled, and publications will continue as planned. For questions, contact [BigDataSE2020 AT googlegroups DOT com].
