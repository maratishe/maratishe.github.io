Workshop on Cloud Continuum Services for Smart IoT Systems (CCIoT)

Call for Papers

Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the hottest topic in the field of communications and computing. Many cloud providers offers cloud/edge services for IoT, to handle big data, to apply AI technologies, to support massive IoT devices, and to provide low-latency control. At the same time 5G cellular networks have Massive IoT as reference scenario, for which a huge number of smart sensors/actuators must be connected with low latency. Cloud and edge computing on the one and 5G on the other hand push for an IoT cloud continuum aimed at simplifying the integration, development and delivery processes of future, cloud-native, IoT applications, also considering related security and privacy issues.

There are many alternatives for cloud and networking services and technologies in forming cloud continuum for IoT. The objectives of this workshop are to create a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss issues in applying cloud/edge computing and AI technologies to IoT systems, in networking IoT devices and federating IoT systems, and in development of IoT services exploiting the computing and networking capabilities of IoT systems, and to set a direction in forming a cloud continuum where IoT systems work together towards well-being of humankind.

Important Dates:
• Deadline for paper submission: September 18, 2020
• Paper acceptance notification: October 9, 2020
• Workshop date: November 16, 2020
