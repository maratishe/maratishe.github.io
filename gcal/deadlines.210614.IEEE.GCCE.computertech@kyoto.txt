Session Title:
2D/3D Video Data Distribution and Processing (OS-VDP)

Session Abstract:
The tremendous advances in audio and video streaming technologies have
created a large consumer electronics field for video distribution and processing.
Extending traditional 2D video technologies, 3D video is recently very attractive
in the field. In order to accelerate this field, further progresses of the researches
on 2D/3D video data distribution and processing are necessary. The aim
of this organized session is to bring together practitioners and researchers
from both academia and industry in order to have a forum for discussion
and technical presentations on this hot field.

Session Topics
- video data distribution
- video data processing
- 3D data
- stream data
- video on demand
