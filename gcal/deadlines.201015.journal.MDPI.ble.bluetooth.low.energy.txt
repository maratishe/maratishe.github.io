Bluetooth Low Energy: Advances and Applications
https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BLE

Call for Papers

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was first specified in 2010. Since then, its
popularity has not ceased to increase. In fact, BLE has become the
dominant low-power wireless technology in a variety of consumer
electronics devices, including the smartphone. The latter is crucially
important, as it brings widespread presence to BLE. This feature of BLE,
along with its suitability for simple, energy-constrained devices (e.g.,
battery-enabled sensors), allows positioning BLE as a fundamental enabler
of networking paradigms such as wireless sensor networks and the Internet
of Things.

BLE technology and BLE-based networking have also expanded in parallel to
their success. The panoply of BLE features, options, and mechanisms has
significantly increased in the last few years. Significant additions to
the BLE universe include several Bluetooth specification updates (the
latest being Bluetooth 5.2), IPv6 support for BLE devices,
and many initiatives for enabling BLE mesh networks.

BLE applications can be found in a wide range of domains, e.g., smart
home, smart cities, smart health, smart agriculture, or Industry 4.0. BLE
is enabling the interaction between humans and smart objects, as well as
between smart objects themselves. BLE has also been leveraged for
innovative location-based applications, opportunistic data collection,
crowd-sensing, etc.

Remarkably, BLE is also playing a fundamental role in the context of
combatting COVID-19. BLE-enabled sensors are being used in hospitals to
remotely collect vital parameter readings (e.g. temperature, blood
pressure, etc.), minimizing the risk of infection for medical personnel.
Furthermore, the widespread presence of BLE in smartphones is crucial to
enable contact tracing applications being developed and used worldwide.

This Special Issue aims at collecting high quality research papers and
review articles focusing on recent advances in BLE. Original, high-quality
contributions that have not been published before and are not currently
under review by other journals or conferences are sought.

Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Performance evaluation (e.g., mathematical analysis, simulation and/or
experimentation) of BLE networks.
- BLE version-oriented studies (Bluetooth 4.x, Bluetooth 5.x).
- Internet connectivity of BLE devices: 6LoWPAN/6Lo, gateway-based
approaches, etc.
- BLE mesh networking standardization efforts: Bluetooth Mesh (Bluetooth
SIG), IPv6 mesh over BLE (IETF), etc.
- Novel approaches to BLE mesh networks.
- Coexistence of BLE with other wireless technologies.
- BLE beacons.
- BLE-based localization.
- BLE-based opportunistic sensor data collection.
- Innovative applications of BLE in smart home, smart cities, smart
transportation, smart agriculture, smart health, Industry 4.0, etc.
- Applications of BLE for combatting COVID-19: parameter monitoring, contact
tracing, etc.

Submission Deadline:     15 October 2020

Papers are published upon acceptance, regardless of the Special Issue
publication date.

The most recent Journal Citation Reports Impact Factor released for MDPI
Sensors is 3.275 (Q1 in the category of ‘Instruments & Instrumentation’).
