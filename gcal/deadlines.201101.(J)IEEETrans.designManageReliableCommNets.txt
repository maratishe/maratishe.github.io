Special Issue on

“Design and Management of Reliable

Communication Networks”



Reliability of communication infrastructure is a top priority for network operators. To ensure reliable network operation, new design and management techniques for reliable communications must be constantly devised to respond to the rapid network and service evolution. As a recent and relevant example, deployments of 5G communication networks will soon enter their second phase, during which the network infrastructure will require upgrades to support new Ultra-Reliable services with availabilities of up to 6 nines. Similarly, disaster resiliency in communication networks is now attracting the attention of media, government and industry as never before (consider, e.g., the worldwide network traffic deluge to support remote working during the current Coronavirus pandemic!). Luckily, several new technical directions can be leveraged to provide new solutions for network reliability as (just to name a few): increased network reconfigurability enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN); integration/convergence of multiple technologies (optical, wireless satellite, datacenter networks); enhanced forms of data/service replication, supported by, e.g., edge computing; network slicing, used to carve highly-reliable logical partitions of network, computing and storage resources. These, and many others, technological transformations can be leveraged to enable next-generation high-reliability networks.



Given the strong interest in both industry and academia towards reliability of telecom networks and cloud-computing infrastructures, we organize an IEEE TNSM special issue that aims at timely publication of recent and innovative research results on this important topic. This special issue is organized in collaboration with the International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN), held in Milan in March this year. DRCN is a well-established forum for scientists from both industry and academy who have interest in reliability and availability of communication networks. As such, this special issue will also invite top-scored DRCN papers to share excellent results and new challenges in the field of reliable communication networks and services.



We welcome submissions addressing important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!
