Welcome to the Annual Wireless Days Conference in its 12th edition, taking place for the second time in Paris. WD is firmly establishing itself as a serious venue for the dissemination of leading-edge state of art knowledge and technologies pertaining to Wireless Communications. Since its inception, it has been offering a stimulating, live environment for discussing new research paths, discoveries, and results among professionals from both Academia and Industry and it has been nurturing fruitful exchange of ideas and positive critics among Wireless Communication and Networking experts.
Wireless Days 2021 will include presentations of both theoretical and experimental achievements, innovative wireless systems, prototyping efforts, case studies, and advances in technology related to wireless networking and communication infrastructures.

The 2021 Wireless Days conference program will be split into the following tracks:

Track 1: Ad hoc and Sensor Networking
Track 2: Connected & Autonomous Vehicles in Land, Water, and Sky
Track 3: IoT and smart X: Networking, Cloudification, and Services
Track 4: Wireless and Mobile Communications: 5G, 6G, Wifi-ng, and beyond
Track 5: Wireless Models and Simulations
Track 6: AI for Wireless and Mobile Networks
Track 7: Wireless and mobile networking technologies for fighting pandemics (Special Track)


Due to ongoing uncertainty about future travel caused by COVID-19, WD 2021 is monitoring the situation and will consider adequate arrangements for the presentations of accepted papers as the situation evolves. We will update this information on a regular basis.
