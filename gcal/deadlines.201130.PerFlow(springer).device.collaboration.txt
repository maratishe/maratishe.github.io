Call for Papers -- PerFlow 2021 (Deadline Extended to Nov. 30)

5th International Workshop on Pervasive Information Flow (PerFlow 2021)
http://www.perflow.org/
March 22 or 26, 2021 (Kassel, Germany)
Due to COVID-19 influence, PerCom2021 and collocated events will be held online.

Co-located with IEEE PerCom 2021

* SCOPE
Internet of Things (IoT) has been attracting attention due to its economic impact and high
expectations for drastically changing our societies. Trillion-scale IoT devices including sensors
and actuators are being installed in various “things” such as machines, humans, vehicles, buildings,
and environments. At the same time, we are facing research challenges on how to effectively, timely
and integratedly handle these over trillion flows (which we call Pervasive Flows) gushed from
massive devices or heterogeneous pervasive systems. Based on the success of our previous workshops,
IFoT 2016, PerFoT 2018 and 2019, and PerFlow 2020, the fifth edition, the 2021 International
Workshop on Pervasive Information Flow (PerFlow 2021) aims to present and discuss research
challenges, design/implementations of new architectures, and experiences on timely
processing/distribution of pervasive flows. In addition, interoperability, integration and
coordination among different applications, services and devices should be discussed for real world
deployment of pervasive systems handling pervasive flows.

*TOPICS
We solicit technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently
under review by another conference or journal. Submissions should clearly identify how they relate
to issues on pervasive flows gushed from various things. Contributions describing an overall working
system and reporting real world deployment experiences are particularly of interest.

Topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- IoT Device Collaboration and Orchestration
- Mobile Data Offloading
- Data Analysis on IoT Devices
- Data Collection via Crowdsensing etc.
- Machine Learning for Data Stream
- Edge and Fog Computing
- Remote Sensing and Monitoring
- Security and Privacy Issues in Pervasive Systems
- Network Architecture/Protocols/Middleware for Pervasive Systems
- Integration of Services/Protocols/Devices for Pervasive Systems
- Interoperability and Interdependence of Heterogeneous Pervasive Systems
- Quality of Service and Energy-Efficiency of Pervasive Systems

* Paper Submission

All paper submissions will be reviewed by at least two program committee members. Papers must be in
PDF format and must be submitted via the submission site shown below. All submissions must describe
original research, not published or currently under review for another workshop, conference, or journal.

Submitted papers should be at most 6 pages in the IEEE template (available at
https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Authors can purchase one additional
page for the camera ready version. Papers can be submitted via the following EDAS submission portal
for PerFlow 2021.
https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=27741&track=103474

Each accepted workshop paper requires a full PerCom registration (no registration is available for
workshops only). Workshop papers will be included and indexed in the IEEE digital libraries (Xplore).
