https://think.taylorandfrancis.com/special_issues/connection-science-recent-trends-digital-twin/?utm_source=TFO&utm_medium=cms&utm_campaign=JPG15743





Digital Twins play a significant part in the advanced manufacturing sector in the design, monitoring, development, and control of products. It is the logical evolution and convergence of a vast number of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, wireless networking, sensor technology, cloud analytics, artificial intelligence, data processing, virtual and augmented visualization of information. It has been recognized as one of the primary key elements of Industry 4.0, in which the significant effort to integrate all manufacturing aspects to secure smooth control and communication across tasks, machinery, and industrial process management.



The Digital Twins reflect graphical representations of assigned physical systems that use on-board sensors, the best computational models, and other input data to provide probabilistic predictions of present or prospective circumstances. A Digital Twin is a multi-dimensional, multi-level to capture the complexity of a physical system and requires regular periodic updates to previous forecasts acquired data.



The scope of the Digital Twin concept is expected to result in differing application details in combination with different missions from government and industry entities. This topic is intended to illustrate these distinctions and parallels, as well as how various organizations should complement each other and explain the possible factors based on recent advancements in the digital twin. The special issue will include a combined contribution to the development of quantitative uncertainty, health monitoring modules, sensing, computational modeling, and others in recognition of future reliability assurance in structural industrial dynamics based on digital twins.



All this provides significant possibilities for industry, technology, financial, legal, and ethical problems. As interactions with the digital twins increase the data collection, which includes personal data, in which protection has become a significant and more challenging issue.



Topics of interest for the special issue include, but not limited to, the following:

• Theory and modeling of digital twins

• Digital Twins technology that enables artificial intelligence, sensors, cloud and cloud computing
