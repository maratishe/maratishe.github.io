“Advanced Sensors and Sensing Technologies  
for indoor positioning and navigation”  


[https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/](https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/)  




Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet  
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust  
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for  
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.  


This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation  
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing  
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,  
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data  
analysis, and applications.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation  
• Sensors for seamless systems: HS-GNSS, indoor GNSS, pseudolites, RTK GNSS  
with handheld devices, mitigating GNSS error when switching to indoor,  
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS  
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation  
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion  
• Sensing for location-based services and applications  
• Sensors benchmarking, assessment, evaluation, standards

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues,  


GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.  
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.  
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.  
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.  
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.  
Keywords  


GNSS  
Urban applications  
Multipath, NLOS  
Hybridization, multisensor fusion  
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)  
Performance analysis and enhancement  
Integrity concepts  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 28 February 2022.  
Ctrl Publication: Immediate online publication once the paper is accepted.

The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021)  
IEEE-CS TCI  


23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy  


[http://www.ficloud.org/2021/](http://www.ficloud.org/2021/)  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.  


The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.  


IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.  


The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues  


Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable  
development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving,  
intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and  
enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the  
construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning  
of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the  
sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization.  
Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide  
alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not  
available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming  
5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the  
massive MIMO technique.  


This Special Issue aims to highlight advances in all aspects of  
high-precision positioning in intelligent transportation systems for  
different objects, including land vehicles, pedestrians, unmanned aerial  
vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles, considering GNSS signals, ground  
signals, and their combinations. Up-to-date reviews and original works are  
both accepted in this issue. Topics include but are not limited to:  


* Multi-GNSS receivers and emerging navigation satellite  
systems;  


* Design, prototyping, and testing of positioning devices;  


* Detection and mitigation techniques for adverse propagation  
conditions;  


* 5G Positioning;  


* Multisensor fusion;  


* Cooperative localization;  


* LiDAR Odometry;  


* Visual Odometry;  


* Simultaneous localization and mapping;  


* Positioning with HD maps.  






・Submission deadline: Jan. 31, 2021  


・Publication: Immediate online publication once the paper is accepted.  






Please refer to this website  
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/special_issues/HPPFITS_SUS) for  
detailed manuscript submission information. Early submissions will receive  
immediate peer review and will be published online after being accepted.

Extended deadline January 22, 2020  


The 1st IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Internet of Things Management  
(https://manage-iot.future-iot.org/)  
co-located with  
IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2021).  
17-21 May 2021// Bordeaux, France  
(https://im2021.ieee-im.org/)  




Scope and topics of the workshop  


The Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a major architectural paradigm for achieving machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. The fundamental principle behind IoT is the concept of a “resource” (or a “thing”), that serves as an abstraction of a basic unit that interacts with its environment, and is capable of providing services, data and control elements to other internetworked resources. Many IoT scenarios can be characterized by lots of (small) traffic, lots of entities, strong heterogeneity in links and device capabilities, strong distribution, and highly sensitive data. Individual nodes have limited compute resources and on-device storage (e.g., consider Raspberry Pi single board computers). Their connectivity is often constrained by factors such as the presence of NATs and firewalls, power constraints, and intermittent network access.  


Managing IoT-based systems is complex and exciting. Though being an evolution from classical management, managing IoT things is still disruptive as classical assumptions about connectivity, compute resources, or usage patterns do not hold anymore.  


The manage-IoT workshop focuses on management methodologies for the Internet of Things. Topics of interest include:  


Resource management  
Managing Internet of things devices and gateways  
Access arbitration to IoT sensors and actuators  
Managing sensors  
Data Management in IoT Systems  
Semantic Modelling of IoT Systems  
Information models/ Domain Specific Languages  
Service Management  
Modular Management  
Autonomous Management including MAPE-K  
IoT runtime environments  
Service Discovery  
Building Blocks  
Machine Learning  
Self-Adapting Systems  
Data Analytics  
Reasoning and Orchestration  
Security and Privacy  
Data and device security  
Privacy protection methodologies.  
Trust management  
Validation and Verification of data and functionality  
Resilience, Survivability, and Dependability  
Other aspects relevant to manage IoT systems

The Third Workshop on the Future of Internet Transport will be held on 21st June 2021 in conjunction IFIP Networking 2021. Please see the Call for Papers below and consider submitting your novel research papers to this workshop.  


Scope of the Workshop  
Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g.,  
transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication;  
transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi;  
transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism;  
transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments;  
SDN and cross-layer transport solutions;  
new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications;  
transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and,  
in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.

Call for Paper  


Since the development of Cloud Computing technology has deeply changed not only the development of computer science but also influenced the way people live. With Cloud-based technology, various kinds of mobile applications to big data-based services are provided to accelerate the data-oriented services. Today, one of the most promising trends is the Cloud-based solutions for small enterprises to deploy their business on Cloud servers. However, privacy and security issues along with the widely developed Cloud-based services are always becoming an obstacle for the usage of the Cloud services. Also, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies such as Deep Learning (DL) have brought new challenges to the traditional security and privacy issues on Cloud Computing. IEEE CSCloud 2020 focuses on these two aspects and aims to gather recent achievements in cybersecurity and cloud computing fields. The conference invites those papers that concentrate on new paradigms, algorithms, and applications in cybersecurity or cloud computing. We also encourage researchers and practitioners to build up the connections between academia and industry. We aim to collect the latest achievements and exchange research ideas in the domains of intelligent data and security at this academic event.  






IEEE CSCloud 2021 is co-located with The 7th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2021)

** CALL FOR PAPERS ** IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop: Emerging Topics in 6G Communications  


Workshop website: [https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home](https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home)  


Venue: International Workshop on Emerging Topics in 6G Communications (ET_6G) which will be held at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC2021) on 14 June 2021.  


5G networks and devices are now a reality with wide deployment and spread among population, but the demand for more data rate is still booming, and will soon need for a newer generation for wireless/cellular communication, the 6G. It will be a new standard that not only provides huge data rate (+1Tbps) and extremely low delay (0.1ms), but also will enable the “hyper-connected” paradigm that will connect users and things. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a major role within 6G, and thus more computation and communication resources will be consumed, where their optimization is a must.  


6G communications will bring new challenges due to their sensitivity to scenario conditions, thereby requiring highly adaptive techniques that will adapt extremely fast, in order to guarantee a delay less than 100 microseconds. Spectrum and resources management will be crucial within 6G in order to account for the extremely heterogeneous scenario. The networks complexity will also be unprecedented, due to the very diverse applications such as ultra‐low latency requirements for critical vehicle communication, the growing demand of high positioning accuracy for location‐based services, and dense heterogeneous architectures. Several emerging topics are encountered within 6G and this workshop will focus on such emerging topics, and potential solutions will be presented. Researchers and engineers from academia and industry are invited to submit their recent results and innovations. The list of topics includes, but not restricted to the following topics:  


Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for 6G communications.  
Novel signal processing techniques for 6G communications.  
Smart Antenna schemes for 6G communications.  
6G communications at the Terahertz band.  
Advanced Full Duplex strategies for 6G.  
Meta-surfaces implementation at 6G communication.  
New Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for 6G communications.  
Multiple Access schemes suitable to 6G.  
Dynamic spectrum access/sharing at 6G band.

Validation Trials for 5G-based IoT Solutions Workshop (5GIoTtrials 2021)  


in conjunction with  
24th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN 2021)  


1 March 2021, Virtual Workshop (https://www.icin-conference.org/workshops/)  


==========================================================================  


5G rollout has started in many parts of the world and is imminent in others. At the same time, IoT services and applications in vertical areas like industry 4.0, smart grids, eHealth and smart cities which utilize the full capabilities of 5G networks are still emerging. Judging by this demand, massive IoT (mIoT) or massive machine-type communication (mMTC) has been identified as one of the three main communication scenarios for 5G. For enabling and accelerating the large-scale rollout of 5G-based IoT solutions in a wide range of vertical sectors, large-scale validation trials are an important step.  


The workshop aims to gather the results of such validation trials for 5G-based IoT solutions in Europe and beyond. In addition to presenting the technological progress and insights gained from these validation trials, the workshop will also foster a multidisciplinary discussion between industry and academia, ICT providers and verticals as well as between the 5G and the IoT research communities. This productive exchange is expected to lead to an identification of existing R&D challenges and new insights on how to address them.  


The workshop is organized in cooperation with the 5G EVE, 5G-VINNI, and 5GENESIS projects. The workshop specifically invites papers on relevant validation trials performed by verticals on the large-scale experimental platforms provided (i.e. 5G infrastructure projects of the 5G PPP or other projects or activities). Papers on validation trials for 5G-based IoT solutions performed in other experimental environments are equally welcome.  


The topical scope for papers includes, but is not limited to:  
• Massive IoT/massive machine-type communication  
• Low power wide area (LPWA) technologies such as NB-IoT, etc.  
• Standards, and architectures for mIoT over 5G  
• Ultra-Reliable, Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)  
• mIoT applications over 5G networks applied to verticals industries, e.g. Industry 4.0, healthcare, wearable systems, smart cities, transport & logistics, mobility, agriculture  
• Autonomous systems and UAVs  
• Security and privacy for mIoT networks  
• 5G network slicing for mIoT  
• Experimental validation of mIoT applications over 5G networks  
• 5G experimentation infrastructures for mIoT  
• Massive mIoT data transport optimization and in-network knowledge extraction

Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation. The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.  


This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:  


Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies  
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems  
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support  
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling  
Medium access control design  
Data centers and cloud systems  
Radio access technology selection  
Spectrum sharing in intra- and inter-tier HetNets  
Traffic load estimation and resource reservation  
User mobility prediction and handover support  
Network fault detection and self-healing  
Network self-configuration and self-organization  
Intrusion detection and self-protection  
Machine learning relevant topics  
Relevant analysis and modelling

COMPSAC 2021  
INTELLIGENT & RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD  
[https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/](https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/)  
JULY 12-16, 2021  


***CALL FOR PAPERS***  


MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO JANUARY 30, 2021  


Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis. Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication. Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely. These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities. But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered. Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently. In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses. As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported. How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing. How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users? For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!  


COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.  


***SUBMISSION***  
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 & C1J2 program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Publishing Policies, and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck portal.

CALL FOR PAPERS  
International Workshop on Big Data in Emergent Distributed Environments (BiDEDE 2021)  


In conjunction with ACM SIGMOD 2021  


June 20, 2021, online  
Submission: February 4, 2021  


Web: [http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/bidede](http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/bidede)  
*************************************************************************************  


** Aims of the Workshop **  


Today, new forms of distributed environments beyond Cloud Computing occur that offer new kinds of applications, but pose new challenges for data management. The recent efforts for serverless computing aim at simplifying the process of deploying code in the Cloud into production by hiding scaling, capacity planning and maintenance operations from the developer or operator. Other initiatives work on avoiding the communication to the Cloud by deploying and running environments for data processing near data sources in Internet-of-Things scenarios (e.g., fog and edge computing) for large-scale smart homes, companies and cities, and near the applications (e.g., Cloudlets for mobile applications and Offline First technologies for web applications).  


Research on distributed data management evolves addressing new challenges specific to these new environments. Properties of emergent distributed environments regarding capabilities of nodes, bandwidth for communication, battery lifetime of nodes, reliability of nodes and communication, and heterogeneity of configurations impact data management mechanisms and approaches, such as those for fault tolerance, replication, resource provisioning, buffer management, query processing and optimization, and transaction management. In addition, federated approaches and polystores spanning over several emergent distributed environments are also remaining research challenges based on the need for combining these different distributed environments into one distributed runtime environment for easy handling of Big Data in different models and globally optimizing data management tasks across these different environments.  


The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to address the challenges and report and exchange the research findings in Big Data in emergent distributed environments, including new approaches, techniques and applications, make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to, and significantly advance the state of the art of Big Data in emergent distributed environments.  


** Categories of Papers **  


The workshop solicits papers of different categories:  
- Research Papers propose new approaches, theories or techniques related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments including new data structures, protocols and algorithms. They should make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to the research field.  
- System Papers describe new data management tools, stream processing engines, databases and other systems, which are able to handle Big Data in emergent distributed environments.  
- Experiments and Analysis Papers focus on the experimental evaluation of existing approaches including data structures and algorithms for Big Data in emergent distributed environments and bring new insights through the analysis of these experiments. Results of Experiments and Analysis Papers can be, for example, showing benefits of well-known approaches in new settings and environments, opening new research problems by demonstrating unexpected behavior or phenomena, or comparing a set of traditional approaches in an experimental survey.  
- Application Papers report practical experiences on applications of Big Data in emergent distributed environments. Application Papers might describe how to apply technologies to specific application domains with big data demands in emergent distributed environments like social networks, web search, e-business, collaborative environments, e-learning, medical informatics, bioinformatics and geographic information system.  
- Vision Papers identify emerging new or future research issues and directions, and describe new research visions having demands for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. The new visions will potentially have great impacts on society.  
- Demo Papers deal with innovative systems and applications for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. These papers describe a showcase of the proposed system/application, but may also explain the novelty of the system's architecture. We are especially interested in demonstrations having a WOW-effect.  
The length of papers must be within 4 pages to 6 pages. Accepted papers will be presented as oral presentations.

ACM SIGCOMM 2021  
August 23–27, 2021  
Virtual Event  
[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/)  


***Important dates***  
- Jan 20, 2021, 16:59 EST -- Abstract registration deadline  
- Jan 27, 2021, 16:59 EST -- Paper submission deadline  
- May 3, 2021 (tentative) -- Notification date  




***Call for Papers***  


The ACM SIGCOMM 2021 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of communication networks and networked systems.  
SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking research, which includes (but is not limited to) the following topics:  


- All types of computer networks such as mobile, wide-area, data-center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks.  
- All types of wired and wireless technologies, including optics, and acoustic and visible light-based communication.  
- All aspects of networks and networked systems such as architecture, packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness, security, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, and interactions with applications.  
- All types of computer network design, analysis, and experimental approaches such as theory, measurements, and machine learning-based techniques.  


We want each SIGCOMM paper to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in networking by, for instance, proposing and developing novel ideas or rigorously (re-)evaluating existing ideas. The review process will take the nature of the contribution into account. We strongly encourage authors to discuss not only the benefits but also the limitations of their work.  


SIGCOMM 2021 will accept submissions to the ***experience track*** in addition to the regular research track. Submissions to the experience track describe the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial or otherwise widely-used deployment. Experience track submissions need not describe new ideas, but are strongly encouraged to elucidate key insights and takeaways gathered from design, deployment, or operational experience. The PC will evaluate experience-track submissions with the understanding that the primary contributions may be in extending the SIGCOMM community’s knowledge of how known techniques fare when adapted to real-world settings, and particularly in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate, for reasons of scale or otherwise. At paper registration time, authors must explicitly indicate both in their paper title and submission form if their paper is to be considered for the experience or regular research track. Submissions to the experience track should also be double-blind. However, given the nature of these papers, it is OK to reveal company or system name but NOT author names. Each submission will only be considered for one track – either the experience or the research track, but not both – in accordance with the authors’ preference expressed at submission time. The final conference program will not preserve the distinction between the two tracks.  


In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2021 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.  




***Submissions***  


Papers submitted to SIGCOMM typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. The program committee will judge submissions based upon novelty, significance, correctness, clarity of presentation, and relevance to the SIGCOMM community. All accepted papers will be shepherded by a member of the program committee.  


Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.  


Submissions and final papers may include appendices (following references, not counting against the 12 pages). Reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result. For accepted papers, the shepherd will review appendices and must approve their need. Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, and code, all appropriately anonymized.  


NOTE: For accepted papers, the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)  


Detailed submission instructions can be found here -- [http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/submission.html](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/submission.html)  


Submission site: [https://sigcomm2021.hotcrp.com](https://sigcomm2021.hotcrp.com)  




***Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers***  


The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2021 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary but strongly encouraged and it has no influence on the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here -- [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging)  




***Public Summaries for Accepted Papers***  


The SIGCOMM 2021 program will feature public summaries accompanying each accepted paper. In most cases, the summary will be written by the paper’s shepherd and will provide an overview of the problem addressed in the paper and its solution, and highlight interesting future questions that arise. The summary may additionally explain aspects of the paper the reviewers particularly liked. Summaries will be published along with the papers in the ACM Digital Library.  




***Ethical Concerns***  


All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement about ethical issues; papers that don’t include such a statement may be rejected. This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.” If the work involves human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, perhaps in a separate subsection.  


Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if human subjects are involved or other people are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report (https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) and the ACM ethics policy (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007 (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.  


Many organizations have an ethics review process (sometimes called an Institutional Review Board, IRB). In some cases, research work may clearly have no human subjects, and formal institutional review may not be required. (However, a sentence in the paper stating this evaluation is still required.) In many cases, IRB involvement is appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor (and should be mentioned), but the program committee will independently evaluate the ethical soundness of the work just as they evaluate its technical soundness.  


The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and the PC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if questions arise.

5TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOG AND EDGE COMPUTING (ICFEC 2021)  


10-13 May 2021, Melbourne, Australia  


In conjunction with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021  
URL: [https://icfec2021.eeecs.qub.ac.uk](https://icfec2021.eeecs.qub.ac.uk)  
=========================================================================  


We are delighted to invite you for the 5th IEEE International  
Conference on Fog and Edge Computing to be held in Melbourne,  
Australia. The conference will be held as part of and in conjunction  
with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer  
Society and ACM.  




INTRODUCTION  
Billions of devices and sensors ranging from user gadgets to more  
complex systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, such as power  
grids or vehicles, from the physical world are getting connected to  
the Internet. However, the need to operate the scale of heterogeneous  
devices and sensors while being performance-efficient in real-time is  
challenging. Typically, the data generated by the devices and sensors  
are transferred to and processed centrally by services hosted on  
geographically distant clouds. This is untenable given the  
communication latency incurred and the ingress bandwidth demand.  


A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry  
experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources  
located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the  
cloud and the edge. These edge resources may be geographically or in  
the network topology be closer to devices and sensors, such as home  
router, gateways or more substantial micro data centers. Edge  
resources may be used to offload selected services from the cloud to  
accelerate an application or host edge-native applications. The  
paradigm within which the edge is harnessed is referred to as  
'Fog/Edge computing'.  


The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of  
service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing,  
and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between  
these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources,  
which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization  
and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management.  
Extensions to current programming and storage models are required and  
new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel  
applications that can benefit from massively distributed and  
data-driven systems need to be developed. Addressing security, privacy  
and trust of the edge resources is of paramount importance while  
managing the resources and context for mobile, transient and hardware  
constrained resources. Lastly, emerging domains like autonomous  
vehicles and machine/deep learning need to be supported over such  
platforms.  




CALL FOR PAPERS  
The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering  
both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific  
applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use  
the edge. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not  
limited to:  
* Data centers and infrastructures for Fog/Edge computing  
* Middleware and runtime systems for Fog/Edge infrastructures  
* Programming models for Fog/Edge computing  
* Storage and data management platforms for Fog/Edge computing  
* Scheduling for Fog/Edge infrastructures  
* Distributed and federated machine learning on Fog/Edge  
* Performance monitoring and metering of Fog/Edge infrastructures  
* Legal issues and business aspects of Fog/Edge computing  
* Security, privacy, trust and provenance issues in Fog/Edge computing  
* Modeling and simulation of Fog/Edge environments  
* Novel, latency-sensitive and locality-critical applications of  
Fog/Edge computing

The 22nd Annual International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2021)  


[https://hotmobile.org/2021/](https://hotmobile.org/2021/)  


Sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE  


February 24-26, 2021  


Cyberspace  






Call for Posters/Demos  




ACM HotMobile 2021, the Twenty-second International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches. HotMobile seeks proposals for posters and demonstrations describing novel work on mobile systems, applications, and services.  


Given the current circumstances, live poster presentations and demos will run in parallel over video link during a dedicated session, with participants being able to drop in and out, as they would in an in-situ setting. As backup, authors of posters and demonstrations will be required to have pre-recorded versions of their poster presentations/demos.  
The poster/demo session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with workshop attendees. Posters are well suited to controversial work that can generate discussion or promising new ideas which have not been thoroughly evaluated. Demos provide an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of your research.  
We are looking for new ways of presenting demos and posters, exploiting the possibility of a video link in original and novel ways. For example, demos can be video streamed from labs (where local provisions permit), outdoors, using web portals/Jupyter notebooks/Colab, or involve app downloads via links provided and user testing.  


The poster/demo session will feature a Best Poster/Demo award.  


Submission  


Submissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5x11-inch page, including all figures and references. Submissions must be made electronically in an email message to the Poster/Demo Chair (paul.patras@ed.ac.uk).  


* subject line for posters: HOTMOBILE POSTER SUBMISSION  
* subject line for demos: HOTMOBILE DEMO SUBMISSION  


*Abstract deadline: Jan 25th, 2021  


More details on the submission process:  


* Please set up your page to be letter size, 8.5x11 inches, two columns, using 10-pt font size for the text body, at least one-inch margin on all sides;

Special Issue on:  
New Trends in High Performance Computing: Software Systems and  
Applications  
Software: Practice and Experience (Wiley Press)  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/assets/page/journal/1097024x/SPE-SI-HPC-1607014410373.pdf)  


Submission due: May 31, 2021  


High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to  
continuously support  
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and  
business domains such  
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and  
financial  
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A  
number of  
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in  
the time  
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are  
developing  
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,  
and methods that  
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.  


Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate  
predictive  
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum  
advances in  
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific  
community. New  
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have  
also been  
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many  
problems that  
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and  
engineering. Training  
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing  
intensive task that  
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era  
will be the  
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep  
learning based  
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart  
manufacturing,  
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.  


While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,  
renovation in  
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance  
delivery. The exascale  
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI  
continue to  
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based  
system,  
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching  
towards  
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many  
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can  
seamlessly  
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute  
resources. We  
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and  
techniques, performance  
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of  
application-level  
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and  
low-level software  
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of  
exascale in many contexts.

+ HPC for AI and AI for HPC  
- AI/ML/DL performance optimizations at applications or system frameworks  
levels on HPC systems

Dear Colleague,  


Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications (QUESTA) will be hosting a special issue on "Learning and Control in Stochastic Networks" with a submission deadline on March 1, 2021. Details below.  


Background and Scope: The theory of stochastic networks and their control is undergoing a phase of exciting collaborative growth with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, fueled by several new applications.  


On the one hand, recent years have seen a surge of interest in the application of machine learning techniques to the control of stochastic networks arising in modern communications applications like cloud computing and data centers, the goal being to design agile control mechanisms that operate under minimal informational assumptions and that adapt to changes in system characteristics over time.  


On the other hand, stochastic networks have emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm for addressing operational questions of matching demand and supply in modern platforms and marketplaces. Examples include ride-sharing platforms, labor platforms, energy markets, etc. A key value proposition of these platforms is the ability to learn from the tremendous amount of transactional data being generated to predict and mitigate supply-demand imbalances, and to recommend and make higher value matches than would otherwise be possible without centralized recommendations and/or matchmaking. Realizing this value proposition requires network control mechanisms that seamlessly assimilate information from data while being robust to strategic concerns.  


These developments have led to a growing body of literature on the control of stochastic networks with novel architectures and at the interface of these control mechanisms with machine learning and strategic behavior. The special issue invites papers addressing novel technical challenges in this domain with direct applications to practice.

Springer AI & SOCIETY - Special issue on AI for People  




- Abstract submission: January 31, 2021  


- Manuscript submission: April 30, 2021  




[https://www.springer.com/journal/146/updates/18583616](https://www.springer.com/journal/146/updates/18583616)  






We invite contributions to a Special Issue on AI for People, to be published by the AI & Society - Journal of Culture, Knowledge and Communication (Springer) [https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.](https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.)  




This Special Issue was born out of the idea of shaping Artificial Intelligence technology around human and societal needs. We believe that technology should respect the anthropocentric principle. It should be at the service of the people, not vice-versa. In order to foster this idea, we need to narrow the gap between civil society and technical experts. This gap is one in knowledge, in action and in tools for change.  






=============================  


SPECIAL ISSUE THEMES  


=============================  


The ‘social good’ is something which benefits the general public, being ‘for’ the people, and at the same time, it is something which reflects and respects their wishes, being ‘from’ the people. The ‘social good’ can be envisioned as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals through collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approaches to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned ‘social good’, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development and sustainability.  


Nowadays, advances in research on AI systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse about the applicability of the AI Ethics principles when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems. AI Ethical principles are guidelines put forward by policy makers that can act as abstractions, as normative constraints on the do’s and don’ts of algorithmic use in society. Themes of transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy must be taken into account when deploying real-world AI systems.  




This Special Issue will focus on the following AI Ethics principles:  


1. Accuracy and Robustness: algorithmic conclusions are probabilities and therefore not infallible and they also might incur in errors during execution. This can lead to unjustified actions.  


2. Explainability and Transparency: a lack of interpretability and transparency can lead to algorithmic systems that are hard to control, monitor, and correct. This is the commonly called ‘black-box’ issue.  


3. Bias and Fairness: conclusions can only be as reliable (but also as neutral) as the data they are based on, and this can lead to bias. An action could be found to be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on one group of people.  


4. Privacy: algorithmic activities, like profiling, can lead to challenges for autonomy and informational privacy.  


5. Accountability: it is hard to assign responsibility to algorithmic harms and this can lead to issues with moral responsibility.  


6. Safety and Security: AI systems need to respect and support privacy rights and data protection while ensuring the security of data.  




The aim of this Special Issue is, however broad, mostly twofold. On one hand, it entails the technical realization of these AI Ethics principles (one or more) in practice. For example, this might refer to specific techniques to ensure principles like ‘fairness’ in an algorithm, with their related practical challenges. On the other hand, it entails addressing these principles from a conceptual standpoint. For example, this might entail, among other things, theorizing, analysing, criticizing and/or further developing the AI principles themselves. Contributions are welcomed from a host of different disciplines, spanning from the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.  






=============================  


CONTRIBUTION TYPES  


=============================  


We welcome contributions across the following formats:  


- Original​ papers (max 10k words): substantial contribution, theory, method, application. Contributions may be experimental, based on case studies, or conceptual discussions of how AI systems affect organisations, society and humans. Original papers will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.  


- Open Forum​ papers (max 8k words): research in progress, ideas paper. Contributions may come from researchers, practitioners and others interested in the topics of the special issue. Contributions might be, but not limited to, discussion papers, literature reviews, case studies, working papers, features, and articles on emerging research. Papers published in the open forum target a broad audience i.e. academics, designers as well as the average reader. Open Forum contributions will be double blind peer-reviewed by two reviewers and the editorial team.  


- Student​ papers (max 6k words): research in progress. Contributions may come from post-graduate students and Ph.D. students interested in the topics of the special issue. For articles that are based primarily on the student’s dissertation or thesis, it is recommended that the student is usually listed as principal author. Papers are double blind peer-reviewed by one reviewer and the editorial team.  


- Curmudgeon​ papers (max 1k words): short opinionated column on trends in technology, science and society, commenting on issues of concern to the research community and wider society. Whilst the drive for artificial intelligence promotes potential benefits to wider society, it also raises deep concerns of existential risk, thereby highlighting the need for an ongoing conversation between technology and society. At the core of Curmudgeon concern is the question: What are the political-philosophical concepts regarding the present sphere of AI technology? Curmudgeon articles will be reviewed by the Journal editors.

Special Issue on "Theoretical Models and Simulations for New Mobile-Computing Architectures"  


MDPI - Telecom Journal  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing)

Submission deadline: February 21st, 2021  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;  
Complex systems and networks;  
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;  
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;  
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;  
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;  
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;  
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;  
Simulation of mobile network structures;  
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;  
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm) FEC  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.

CALL FOR PAPERS  


Special Issue on "Theoretical Models and Simulations for New Mobile-Computing Architectures"  


MDPI - Telecom Journal  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom/special_issues/Simulations_Mobile-Computing)  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Important Dates:  
================  


Submission deadline: February 21st, 2021  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;  
Complex systems and networks;  
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;  
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;  
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;  
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;  
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;  
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;  
Simulation of mobile network structures;  
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;  
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.

Critical Infrastructures are defined as “assets, systems or part thereof which are essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.” Critical Infrastructures refer to a multitude of sectors, including energy, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare and public safety. Systems deployed within these sectors integrate both information technologies and operational technologies, being commonly reliant on legacy industrial control and cyber-physical systems. Nevertheless, novel disruptive and enabling information and communication technologies are increasingly integrated, increasing connectivity and interdependencies, thus presenting security professionals with significant challenges in maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of such infrastructures. This Special Issue invites submissions that present innovative ideas, proof of concepts, use cases, and results from a variety of topics relevant to critical infrastructure cybersecurity and resilience, including (but not limited to) the following ones:

Journal of Network and Systems Management  
Special Issue on Network management for beyond 5G systems  
============================================================================================  


Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems are expected to provide a significant increase in data rates, ultra-low latency, enhanced connectivity of a massive number of devices, and improvements in the network energy efficiency. In order to successfully implement and deploy such networks, significant novel contributions and innovations are required in the area of wireless network management.  


Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the last 5-10 years have provided a new set of algorithms and tools to solve challenging problems in multiple domains by learning complex relationships directly from data. These kinds of algorithms are also very promising to empower a new generation of fully automated network management mechanisms. However, new challenges emerge, such as deciding when to use traditional management algorithms, AI-based models, or even hybrid approaches; design AI models tailor-made for mobile management problems; decide where they have to be deployed (fog vs. edge); and how to manage their life cycle (from data harvesting to intelligent decision making).  


This special issue focuses on novel research in algorithms (especially AI-based) for network management in beyond 5G systems. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for wireless networks and system management using AI. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardisation status, and new future issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  




* Novel non-AI-based algorithms for network management in B5G systems with benchmarking against their AI-based counterparts using performance metrics such as solution optimality, algorithm complexity, resource demands, energy consumption, etc.  
* AI-based algorithms for network slicing in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for service function chaining and orchestration in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for allocation and management of resources (e.g., spectrum, storage, computing, processing) in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for network state prediction  
* Architectures and frameworks for AI-based network and system management in B5G systems  
* Strategies for designing, training, and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI-based algorithms for wireless network management in resource-constrained environments  
* Guidelines and performance evaluation of AI-based algorithms with objectives and loss functions that are specifically designed for management in B5G systems  
* Energy-efficient techniques for data pre-processing, resource allocation, and model training and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems  
* AI application to Open and Virtual Radio Access Networks.

JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON  






Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19  




PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021  






Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:  




● Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks  


● AI/ML applied to epidemic data

outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.  


This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation  
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing  
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,  
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data  
analysis, and applications.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation  
• Sensors for seamless systems: HS-GNSS, indoor GNSS, pseudolites, RTK GNSS  
with handheld devices, mitigating GNSS error when switching to indoor,  
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS  
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation  
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion  
• Sensing for location-based services and applications  
• Sensors benchmarking, assessment, evaluation, standards  




Solicited and invited papers shall undergo the standard IEEE Sensors Journal  
peer-review process. All manuscripts must be submitted on-line, via the IEEE

Special Issue on Mobile and Edge Computing Systems  








The ubiquitous deployment of mobile computing platforms and embedded Internet of Things devices have catalyzed the development of various computing services deeply embedded to our everyday lives. Recently with relatively more powerful edge platforms, computationally heavy tasks that could not be previously enabled using resource limited mobile and embedded platforms can be realized to enable a richer set of localized services. The combination of mobile and edge computing systems has enabled the use of tasks such as various deep learning techniques and computationally heavy blockchains to mobile and embedded computing scenarios, but have also introduced new challenges related to utilizing the limited resources, maintaining user privacy and preserving energy efficiency.  






The objective of this special issue is to explore recent advances in mobile and edge computing systems to address practical and fundamental challenges. Networking, security, and AI-based schemes to support mobile and edge computing systems as well as application designs are all potential topics that can collectively tackle such challenges. Specifically, potential topics include but are not limited to the following:  






● Intelligent deployment of mobile and edge computing systems  


● Deep learning technologies for mobile and edge computing  


● Novel communication and network paradigms for mobile and edge computing

CALL FOR PAPERS  
Elsevier Vehicular Communications (2019 IF: 4.706)  
Special Issue on  
“Revolutionary Paradigms for Smart Connected Vehicles in the 6G Era”  


[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary)  
==================================================================  


By jointly involving multiple challenging requirements, such as  
ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communications, high  
efficiency and capacity, intelligent driving is one of the most  
ambitious and attractive applications of the 6G initiatives. Although  
the convergence of communication, caching, control and computing (4C)  
resources can be leveraged to effectively enable 6G services and  
applications over vehicle-to-everything (V2X) channels, multiple  
challenges must be addressed to allow connected vehicles to meet the  
6G requirements, to securely and efficiently orchestrate their  
resources and to develop self-organizing and self-sustaining  
capabilities.  


Emerging communication paradigms that make effective data transmission  
in very high dynamic contexts include the reprogrammability of the  
environment by the means of Reprogrammable Intelligent Metasurfaces  
(RIMs). Moreover, Visible Light Communication (VLC) can improve the  
reliability of V2X interactions and be effective in terms of security  
and enhanced data rate. With focus on networking aspects, Software  
Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) can  
bring programmability, flexibility and scalability in connected  
vehicles, simplify network management and promote an efficient and  
fair use of the distributed 4C resources and programmable  
metasurfaces. They can be complemented by revolutionary networking  
models, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), to provide  
distributed caching and computing services.  


This special issue aims to collect proposals that deal with  
revolutionary communication and networking technologies for connected  
vehicles, in a holistic fashion or at different layers, to meet the  
expectations of the 6G era.  


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  


Software-defined vehicular networks  
Vehicular cloud computing in the 6G era  
Fog/edge computing architectures for connected vehicles  
Integration of SDN/NFV and vehicular cloud computing  
Information Centric Networking for Connected Vehicles  
Impact of connected vehicles on transportation safety, management,  
characterization, and prediction  
Mobile sensing networking, sensor data collection and multi-modal fusion  
Caching strategies for connected vehicles  
Joint management of communication, control, computing and caching for  
6G vehicular applications and services  
Optical wireless technologies for 6G vehicular applications and services  
Reprogrammable and Intelligent Metasurfaces for smart connected vehicles

DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -  


JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING  


WEBSITE:  
[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future)  


SCOPE:  
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.  


To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.  


The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.  


These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  
======================  
Article Collection "Automatic Performance Management and Optimization on Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters"  
Frontiers in Big Data Journal  
[https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs](https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs)  




Introduction  
------------  
Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.  


As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.  




Topics of Interest  
------------------  
The topics of the Article Collection include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Automated resource allocation in heterogeneous clusters  
• Workload and task scheduling in heterogeneous environments  
• Performance optimization and tuning of data-parallel applications  
• Automated data management in heterogeneous and emerging storage systems  
• Automatic parameter tuning in big data processing systems  
• Automatic big data systems tuning that is robust to workload and resource uncertainty

Dr. Michael Sheng, Macquarie University, Australia  
Dr. Arun Kumar Sangaiah, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, India  
Dr. Ankit Chaudhary, University of Missouri at Saint Louis, USA  


journal cover imageThe Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to IoMT. IoMT is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge about fifty years ago, CL has grown and developed exponentially.  


Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-based multimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a new research paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. In particular, this special issue will narrow down to focus on multimedia IoT services in real time systems and there are open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL. Moreover, this SI will explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between CL and IoMT applications including multi-model metadata generation, computational content analysis (text services, audio-visual filtering syntactic and semantic interoperability etc).  


By organizing this special issue, we aim at presenting recent and significant developments in the applications of CL with IoMT services.

journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.  


Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.  


This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.

The author would provide his/her presentation to the congress via an FTP web link (presentation video) as well as the PowerPoint slides, or  
The author presents his/her talk via Skype/Zoom/... In this case, the presentation should not go over 15 minutes (i.e., this would allow 5 additional minutes for Q&A)  




Important Dates  






February 08, 2021: Workshops/Sessions Proposals  


March 12, 2021: Submission of full papers (about 7 pages)  


April 09, 2021: Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)
