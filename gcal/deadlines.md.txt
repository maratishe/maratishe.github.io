Dear all,  


you are invited to consider publication in the MPDI Sensors Special Issue on "Green Sensors Networking".  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network)  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.  


Special Issue Information  


Recent improvements in integrated circuit technology have led to the development of new low-cost, tiny sensor nodes. Consequently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being introduced into many different application areas, such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, wearables, transportation, security, surveillance, and other industrial needs. WSNs consist of a large number of self-sustainable, autonomous devices that are able to sense their environment and process and transmit related data. Sensor nodes are commonly hardware-constrained devices that must work under severe resource restrictions such as limited battery, communication, storage, and computing capabilities. In particular, to cope with the scarcity of available energy and to ensure long-term operation, sensor nodes must be designed with low energy radio and sensing units, employ energy efficient communication protocols, and implement optimal energy management policies.  
The key for reducing energy consumption in WSNs is the wise utilization of network resources, including power, spectrum, time, and spatial resources. For example, in these networks involving a large number of distributed devices, cooperative power control techniques based on convex optimization or game theory permit governing transmission power efficiently. Furthermore, energy-harvesting technology is frequently used to provide a virtually uninterrupted power supply to the sensor nodes although, due to the intermittent and variable nature of ambient energy sources, accurate prediction schemes of future energy availability may be required to avoid energy shortages.  


Energy demands of WSNs can also be reduced, alleviating mutual interference through efficient MAC protocols, employing energy-aware routing algorithms or exploiting available power-saving modes at the sensor nodes. Finally, advanced distributed storage and computation schemes that decrease the number of transmissions and receptions for data collection and dissemination can be adopted to save energy in these networks.  


The purpose of this Special Issue is to present the most recent advances, or comprehensive reviews, relating to green wireless sensor networks. Potential topics include but are not limited to:  


Energy harvesting;  
Distributed power control schemes;  
Energy efficient WSN architecture and design;  
Energy efficient communication protocols for WSNs;  
Green MAC protocols for WSNs;  
Green routing algorithms for WSNs;  
Green device-to-device communications;  
Green computing for sensor nodes;  
Energy management policies for sensor nodes;  
Energy availability prediction schemes.

*Submission Deadline: 30 November 2020*  


Smart city is the culmination of applying cutting-edge cyber-physical concepts to city resource management scenarios such as water supply, energy distribution, transportation management and public safety to streamline them for higher operational efficiencies. This is made possible by the tremendous recent advancement in technologies such as cloud computing, computer networking, and Internet of Things. In smart city deployments, sensors and actuators that generate and consume massive volumes of data under diverse formats and ontologies will be integrated into the overall system. The data created by the participating devices need to be appropriately classified and related so that duplication and conflicts can be minimized. To handle the massive volumes of data in a timely manner and to prevent overloads in the cloud infrastructure, newer edge computing paradigms need to be developed.  


This special issue mainly focuses on software services and cyber infrastructure of smart cities, addressing both original algorithmic development and new applications. We are soliciting original contributions, of leading researchers and practitioners from academia as well as industry, which address a wide range of theoretical and application issues in this domain.

-------------  


Motivations  
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;  


- Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;  


- Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;  


- Graph-based representations to space and time phenomena;  


- Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning;  


- Multiscale modelling;  


- Combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;  


- Spatiotemporal query languages within GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal GIS interfaces;  


- Temporal indoor GIS;  


- Location-based time GIS;  


- Real-time GIS;  


- Temporal web and wireless GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal technologies;  


- Spatiotemporal urban and environmental GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal semantic web;  


- Spatiotemporal data mining.

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Deadline: 31 December 2020  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC)  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.  


This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.  


Possible topics include but are not limited to:  


Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;  
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;  
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;  
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;  
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);  
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;  
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;  
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;  
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;  
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;  
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.

Special Issue Information  


The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network connecting billions of  
physical objects and devices that are capable of sensing and sharing  
data between themselves and the Internet. Hence, one of the core goals  
of an IoT system is to provide a digital overlay of information over the  
physical world, in domains such as industries, smart cities,  
transportation, and energy. Thus, sensing and embedded systems are key  
enabling technologies for the IoT vision.  


The increasing popularity of IoT applications is driving an exponential  
growth in connected IoT devices and generated data. As a result, the  
current IoT system architectures and communication technologies are  
facing significant technical challenges to meet the requirements of  
connectivity, scalability, and interoperability, as well as to  
efficiently support the transmission and processing of large volumes of  
data. Hence, there is a need for new enabling technologies, end-to-end  
architectures, and data management platforms. This Special Issue aims to  
foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas,  
approaches, theories, and practice to resolve the challenging issues  
related to the development of IoT ecosystems. Comprehensive review  
papers on the emerging research trends in the IoT domain are highly  
encouraged.

Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that ...," sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that ..." should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1] A. Clark …., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."  
The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.  
The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.  
Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.  




At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.

Special Issue on Mobile and Edge Computing Systems  
The ubiquitous deployment of mobile computing platforms and embedded Internet of Things devices have catalyzed the development of various computing services deeply embedded to our everyday lives. Recently with relatively more powerful edge platforms, computationally heavy tasks that could not be previously enabled using resource limited mobile and embedded platforms can be realized to enable a richer set of localized services. The combination of mobile and edge computing systems has enabled the use of tasks such as various deep learning techniques and computationally heavy blockchains to mobile and embedded computing scenarios, but have also introduced new challenges related to utilizing the limited resources, maintaining user privacy and preserving energy efficiency.  
The objective of this special issue is to explore recent advances in mobile and edge computing systems to address practical and fundamental challenges. Networking, security, and AI-based schemes to support mobile and edge computing systems as well as application designs are all potential topics that can collectively tackle such challenges.

Recently a Transformative Computing paradigm has been developed, and define as a new branch of modern computer sciences and information technologies. This new approach allow to join sensor signals and wireless communication technologies, with extensive signal/data analysis using AI technologies. The main idea of this emerging technology, is connection of low level signal acquisition, originating from smart or IoT sensors, with global communication, which allow to transmit and collect required data in secure manner for further semantic analysis or extensive analytical evaluation. Final data analysis should involve application of advanced soft computing or AI approaches. Such connection enhances computing possibilities, by increasing efficiency of data extraction, acquisition, and exploration, as well as performing more sophisticated analysis at different levels starting from sensor networks till augmented cognition. It can also be applicable for solving complex real life problems thanks to the application of computational intelligence approaches, oriented on using of novel methods like cognitive computing, which is based on models of human visual perception. Such human oriented data analysis and information processing approaches allow to deeply analyse a great amount of signals and information sourced from IoT, smart technologies, multimedia, and VR, manage them, and securely transmit over global networks.

Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19  






Brief description/Scope  






COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).  


Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.  






Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Dear Colleagues  


Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable  
development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving,  
intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and  
enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the  
construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning  
of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the  
sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization.  
Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide  
alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not  
available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming  
5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the  
massive MIMO technique.  


This Special Issue aims to highlight advances in all aspects of  
high-precision positioning in intelligent transportation systems for  
different objects, including land vehicles, pedestrians, unmanned aerial  
vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles, considering GNSS signals, ground  
signals, and their combinations. Up-to-date reviews and original works are  
both accepted in this issue. Topics include but are not limited to:  


* Multi-GNSS receivers and emerging navigation satellite  
systems;  


* Design, prototyping, and testing of positioning devices;  


* Detection and mitigation techniques for adverse propagation  
conditions;  


* 5G Positioning;  


* Multisensor fusion;  


* Cooperative localization;  


* LiDAR Odometry;  


* Visual Odometry;  


* Simultaneous localization and mapping;  


* Positioning with HD maps.  






・Submission deadline: Jan. 31, 2021  


・Publication: Immediate online publication once the paper is accepted.  






Please refer to this website  
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/special_issues/HPPFITS_SUS) for  
detailed manuscript submission information. Early submissions will receive  
immediate peer review and will be published online after being accepted.

Scope:  
======  


In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific  
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service  
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been  
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different  
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility  
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average  
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also  
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as  
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed  
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new  
path rearrangements.  


This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the  
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,  
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding  
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive  
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical  
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of  
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary  
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.  




The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:  


Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;  
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;  
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;  
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;

********** Call for Papers **********  


Dear Colleagues,  


GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.  
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.  
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.  
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.  
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.  
Keywords  


GNSS  
Urban applications  
Multipath, NLOS  
Hybridization, multisensor fusion  
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)  
Performance analysis and enhancement  
Integrity concepts

IEEE Sensors Journal Special Issue on  
“Advanced Sensors and Sensing Technologies  
for indoor positioning and navigation”  


[https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/](https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/)  




Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet  
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust  
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for  
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing  
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and  
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the  
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us  
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological  
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,  
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of  
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.  


This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation  
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing  
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,  
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data  
analysis, and applications.

including:  


• Sensors and sensing technologies for indoor navigation and tracking methods:  
AoA, TOF, TDOA based localisation, RSSI and magnetic fingerprinting, PDR,  
IMU and hybrid systems, UWB, ultrasound, optical systems, RFID, radar,  
device-free systems, mapping, SLAM  
• Sensing frameworks and fusion for hybrid positioning  
• Cooperative sensing, machine learning systems  
• Sensors for building indoor maps and 3D models  
• Sensors for human motion monitoring and modelling  
• Sensors for robotics and UAV positioning and navigation  
• Sensors for seamless systems: HS-GNSS, indoor GNSS, pseudolites, RTK GNSS  
with handheld devices, mitigating GNSS error when switching to indoor,  
industrial metrology & geodetic systems, iGPS  
• Self-contained sensors for positioning and navigation  
• Wearable and multi-sensor systems for indoor navigation and human motion
