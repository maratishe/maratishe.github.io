CALL FOR PAPERS  


Elsevier Online Social Networks and Media Journal (OSNEM)  


Special issue on  
Online/Mobile Social Networking at the time of COVID-19  


Submission Deadline: July 31st, 2020  
[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/online-social-networks-and-media/](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/online-social-networks-and-media/)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


The outbreak of COVID-19 is revolutionising our daily habits and  
individual/social behaviour, with many physical activities being "migrated"  
to the online world. On the other hand, we are relying more and more on  
online services to track and fight the diffusion of the new virus.  
While these phenomena are a consequence of an emergency situation,  
it is very likely that such changes will have a significant long-term impact.  


Online and Mobile Social Networks are a particularly intriguing environment  
in this framework. The OSNEM usage has changed dramatically since the emergence  
of the pandemic. Moreover, OSNEM can be used to shed light, through big data analysis,  
on novel individual and social behaviours of people. Last but not least, OSNEM are  
increasingly used to track the pandemic, via Online and Mobile Social Platforms  
helping to track physical contacts between people. As the role of OSNEM is becoming  
ever more important, challenges and threats to privacy, trust in information,  
fake news, malicious behaviour are posing even more serious threats.  


This special issue seeks high-quality scientific articles (both theoretical and  
experimental) on the use of OSNEM at the time of COVID-19, to either characterise  
the human behaviour via large-scale OSNEM data analysis, or using OSNEM to  
fight the pandemic. Papers describing the process used to collect and use  
large-scale datasets from OSNEM platforms are welcome, provided datasets are  
made available to the research community.  


Topics include, but are not limited to:  
- Characterisation of OSNEM usage at the time of COVID-19 via OSNEM big data analysis  
- Models of individual and social behaviour through OSNEM big data during the pandemic  
- Characterisation of social network structures during pandemic via OSNEM large-scale data  
- Opinion formation, information diffusion and polarization related to COVID-19  
- Tracking of COVID-19 diffusion through Online Social Networks analysis  
- Mobile Social Networking applications and services to fight the COVID-19 diffusion  
- COVID-19 e-health services based on OSNEM  
- Privacy issues in the use of Online and Mobile Social Networks to fight COVID-19  
- Tools to detect and counteract disinformation and malicious behaviours  
related the COVID-19 phenomena  
- Tools to assess and verify trustworthiness of COVID-19 related information and accounts  
- OSNEM data-driven approaches to study COVID-19 related phenomena  
- Multidisciplinary applications of OSNEM (economics, medicine, society, politics,  
homeland security, etc.) to fight COVID-19  
- COVID-19 publicly available OSNEM datasets: collection, usage and sharing  


Online Social Networks and Media is a multidisciplinary journal for the wide community  
of computer and network scientists working on developing OSNEM platforms and services  
and using OSNEM as a big data source to mine, learn and model the (online) human behaviour.  
Manuscripts only based on questionnaires, even focused on the reported use of social media,  
are outside the scope of the journal. On the other hand, the journal welcomes papers which  
present analyses based on big data mined from social networks/media.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Schedule  
Manuscript submission deadline: July 31st, 2020  
First notification: September 30th, 2020  
Submission of revised paper: October 31st, 2020  
Notification of acceptance: November 30th, 2020  


Guest Editors  
Marco Conti, IIT-CNR, Italy  
Andrea Passarella, IIT-CNR, Italy  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Instructions for submission  


Manuscripts must not have been previously published nor currently under review  
by other journals or conferences. Papers previously published in conference proceedings  
are eligible for submission if the submitted manuscript is a substantial revision  
and extension of the conference version. In this case, authors should indicate  
the previous publication(s) in the cover letter and are also required to submit  
their published conference article(s) and a summary document explaining the enhancements  
made in the journal version. The submission website for this journal is located at  
[https://www.editorialmanager.com/osnem/default.aspx.](https://www.editorialmanager.com/osnem/default.aspx.)  


Please select "VSI:COVID-19" when you reach the "Article Type" step in the submission process.  
To ensure that all manuscripts are correctly identified, for consideration by the special issue,  
the authors should indicate in the cover letter that the manuscript has been submitted  
for the special issue on “Online/Mobile Social Networking at the time of COVID-19”.  


Manuscripts can be submitted continuously until the deadline. Once a paper is submitted,  
the review process will start immediately. Accepted papers will be published continuously  
in the journal (in the first issue available as soon as the paper is accepted).  
All accepted papers will be listed together in an online virtual special issue published  
in the journal website.

Dear Colleagues,  


I would be glad if you, and others from your Research Group, would accept the invitation to contribute to:  


Special Issue: "Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) Communication”  
Information Journal - ISSN:2078-2489 (Scopus, SCImago)  
Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 July 2020  


Dear Colleagues,  


The growing number of moving vehicles, motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians, mainly in the urban environment, leads to an increased number of accidents, traffic jams, and to higher levels of energy consumption and pollution. Traffic accidents take thousands of lives each year and cause critical injuries to millions of persons; nevertheless, vehicles, as standalone machines, are getting safer, more efficient, more comfortable, and providing an overall better user experience, with increasing levels of automation.  


Vehicles use on-board communication units in order to exchange data with each other and with any infrastructural support, by means of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) interactions, generically classified as “Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication”.  


V2X communication systems enable information sharing and usage of cooperative approaches in order to increase road safety, avoid accidents and traffic congestions, give priority to emergency vehicles, and also cope with vulnerable road users. New and challenging V2X research issues arise from recent technologic developments, allowing the growth of either assisted or autonomous driving modes.  


This Special Issue on “Vehicle-To-Everything Communication” is aimed at recent research findings, coming both from industry and academic R&D, with important contributions to ITS application development, either at safety, efficiency, management, and comfort or infotainment areas. The key areas of this Special Issue include but are not limited to:  


- V2X for cooperative and autonomous driving;  


- cellular V2X communications;  


- V2X for extended sensing and autonomous awareness;  


- V2X for emergency vehicles;  


- V2X for smart mobility;  


- V2X modeling and testing; safety, security, and privacy in V2X;  


- connected vehicles and vulnerable road users;  


- simulation platforms for V2X;  


- new vehicular network architectures;  


- named data networks for connected vehicles.

sCOPE  






Urban IoT promises to deliver massive amounts of data and fundamentally change our understanding of these systems. This should have a very positive impact in the operation of many urban services, and lead to more resource-efficient and affordable infrastructures.  


However, the deployment of cutting edge IoT technology is not a solution just by itself. Its success depends on the ability to integrate the city fabric and become an integral part of urban services across multiple areas, such as mobility, buildings, utility, public safety, healthcare or education.  


Also, taking in consideration the recent COVID-19 pandemic, visions and challenges for smart cities are now being greatly and dynamically influenced and changed. In this context, Urb-IoT 2020 also welcomes ambitious papers such as visioning or recent data analysis papers that reflect current world issues.  


We are pleased to invite you to submit your paper to Urb-IoT 2020. Submissions should be in English, following the Springer formatting guidelines (see Submission).

IEEE TALE 2020  


VIRTUAL CONFERENCE  
8-11 December 2020  


[https://tale2020.org/](https://tale2020.org/)  


SECOND ROUND CALL FOR PAPERS  


Submission Deadline: 17 August 2020, JST (Hard Deadline)  




IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT  


The IEEE Education Society and TALE 2020 Organizing Committee have been closely monitoring developments related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the safety and wellbeing of all conference participants being our foremost priority. In light of the guidance and recommendations of the relevant international and national health organizations, we have made the decision to switch from our plans for a face-to-face event in Takamatsu, Japan to a fully online conference format. Importantly, the dates of the conference will remain the same, and all papers that are accepted, registered, and presented will still be published in the proceedings that will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore. The specific online platform(s) that will be used to host the conference will be announced in the coming weeks.  




OVERVIEW  


TALE is the IEEE Education Society's premier conference series in the Asia-Pacific region ( [http://www.tale-conference.org/](http://www.tale-conference.org/) ). It aims to provide a forum for scholars and practitioners to share their knowledge and experience in engineering and technology education, as well as in technology-enabled educational innovation across a variety of academic and professional disciplines. The target audience of the conference is diverse and includes those working in the higher education, vocational education and training (VET), K-12, corporate, government and healthcare sectors.  


The theme of this year's conference is "Embarking on a new era of learning with transformative technologies."  


The conference theme challenges us to look anew at how the potential of current and emerging technologies can and/or should be harnessed for education and learning in our ever-changing world. Over the last several decades, digital technologies have revolutionized the way we work, play and learn—arguably changing our lives for the better overall—but they have not come without their problems and challenges (e.g., environmental degradation, social inequity arising from the "digital divide," ethical and moral dilemmas brought about by artificial intelligence). Over the next ten years (2020–2029), technologies such as AI, robotics, brain–computer interfaces, and extended or cross-reality (XR) that augment human sensory abilities, cognition and performance will continue to evolve and have a transformative impact. How can we ensure this transformation is positive, both for and through learning? As these technologies increasingly blur the boundaries between human and machine, and between physical and virtual, what can we do so the technology works toward our advantage, for the betterment of all of society and of our planet? Participants of TALE 2020 are encouraged to engage with these and other questions from creative, multidimensional and interdisciplinary perspectives as we stand on the precipice of this new era of learning with transformative technologies.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND REVIEW  


Prospective authors are invited to prepare submissions of two (2) to eight (8) A4 pages (including tables, figures and references) in standard IEEE double-column format, using the following template:  
[http://tale2020.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/conference-template-a4.docx](http://tale2020.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/conference-template-a4.docx)  


Use of any other IEEE templates is NOT acceptable as there are subtle differences between those templates and the conference template that will affect the consistency in appearance of papers published in the proceedings. Importantly:  
• Do not change the paper size (A4) or margins in the template.  
• The headers and footers must remain empty. (They should not contain page numbers or anything else!)  
• Formatting of the paper must be done using the pre-defined MS-Word styles in the template, rather than manually. The paper must use all the predefined font styles, sizes etc. as per the template.  
• Basic examples of citations and references are included in the template, but authors are required to fully adhere to the guidelines and instructions stipulated in the IEEE Reference Guide at [http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf.](http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf.) (Where are conflicts between the template and the IEEE Reference Guide, the IEEE Reference Guide prevails.)  
• Please ensure that all template text (guidance text for composing and formatting conference papers) is removed from your conference paper prior to submission.  


Papers will be accepted only by electronic submission through the conference website, from which guidelines and templates are available. Submissions will not be accepted via e-mail. A blind peer-review process will be used to evaluate all submitted papers. For more information and to access the submission system, please visit the conference website.  


Please note that due to the tight timelines, in the second CFP round, authors whose papers are accepted or conditionally accepted will have only about one week to complete their revisions and submit their camera-ready versions. Consequently, in this round papers requiring extensive revisions are more likely to be rejected outright than in the first round.  


Paper Submission System (ConfTool): [https://www.conftool.net/tale-conference/](https://www.conftool.net/tale-conference/)  


PUBLICATION AND INDEXING  


All accepted and registered full, short and work-in-progress papers that are presented at TALE 2020 as well as all extended abstracts describing the nontraditional sessions presented at the conference will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to the IEEE Xplore® digital library. Content loaded into Xplore is made available by IEEE to its abstracting and indexing partners, including Elsevier (Scopus, Ei Compendex), Clarivate Analytics (CPCI—part of Web of Science) and others, for potential inclusion in their respective databases.  


In addition, the authors of selected papers may be invited to submit revised and expanded versions of their papers for possible publication in the IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies (2019 JCR Impact Factor: 2.714) or another Scopus and/or Web of Science-indexed journal, subject to the relevant journal's regular editorial and peer-review policies and procedures.

JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON  


THZ WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  
PUBLICATION DATE: April 2021  






Terahertz wireless communications in the frequency band from 100GHz to 10THz is a rapidly growing and is considered as very feasible new area which can enable an order of 0.1 Tbps personal communications over vast available channels as well as chip-to-chip, massive IoT connections, and many other applications. Especially, the recent significant progress on RF technologies anticipates the THz wireless systems realizable in the near future and is discussed in the academy and the industry for possible new frequency band in beyond 5G cellular systems. Recent works on THz wireless communications have been focused on the propagation studies, channel capacity of MIMO systems, general consideration of system characteristics, RF transceiver design.  


Despite the enormous studies in THz wireless communications in the last decade, the state-of-art is far from meeting the challenges of the near-future communication systems in terms of communication system design and usage model considering the characteristics of THz band. In particular, the possible coverage of a cell using THz band needs to be clearly studied based on the current and the near coming RF technologies.  


This special issue on Terahertz Communications seeks original research articles as well as expository and survey papers, addressing the challenges of future THz wireless communications systems. Example topics of interest:  




ü Information theoretic foundation of THz wireless communications  


ü RF technologies for personal communications  


ü Beamforming and MIMO  


ü Machine learning aided THz communications  


ü Resource allocation and multiple-access schemes for THz communications  


ü Protocol design for THz networking

*MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSIONS*  


Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. Please visit the submission link to send your manuscript:  
[http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2020](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2020)  
(The submission site will open soon)  


Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere and must be  
cleared for publication in the NCA Proceedings, which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. The manuscript  
must be written in English, and must not exceed 8 pages for NCA papers or 4 pages for workshop papers. Following last year's  
success, NCA also invites manuscripts presenting Work-in-Progress (WiP), which must not exceed 3 pages. More details about  
the WiP track can be found in the NCA website. All submissions must be in PDF format.  




Manuscript page limit:  


Regular Papers: 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.  
Short Papers: 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.  
WiP Papers: 3 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.  




Purchasing extra pages:  


Regular Papers: Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at $100 (US dollars) per extra page.  
Short Papers: Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at $100 (US dollars).  


Authors can decide to submit papers longer than 8/4 pages (up to 10 and 5, depending on the category) before the reviewing  
process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore, longer  
papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions, in case of acceptance. This is to respect the work made by  
reviewers and other authors who decided to stay in the limits.  




*ACCEPTED PAPERS AND PUBLICATION POLICIES*  


Every paper accepted at NCA must have attached to it at least one registration at the full (member or non-member) rate. Thus,  
for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration  
rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation for up to  
two (2) papers.  


No-show papers are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper at the technical meeting.  
This year, due to COVID-19, NCA will be a fully virtual conference, with no travel involved. All presentations will be given  
via pre-recorded videos, followed by synchronized online discussions during the conference period. For an accepted paper to not  
be considered as "no-show", at least one of its authors will have to prepare a video presentation and provide it to the organizers  
who will make it available to the participants of the conference. Moreover, at least one author of the accepted paper will have  
to participate to the online discussions that are relevant to their paper. Instructions for these will be provided at the NCA  
website.  


Presentations by proxies are not allowed, unless explicitly approved *before* the conference by the technical co-chairs. No-show  
papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings must be identified as "No-Show" in the files submitted to IEEE  
for further publication (IEEE Xplore). No-shows will not be available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE will  
maintain an archive of no-shows.  


The IEEE strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program.  


If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE policy dictates that the  
request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE policy also states that in this case,  
the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the  
expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in

Nanotechnology continues to revolutionize a wide variety of fields by paving the way toward sub-µm scale devices (i.e., in the order of a few hundred nanometers). Controlling materials on such a scale is expected to give rise to integrated nanodevices with simple sensing, actuation, data processing and storage, and communication capabilities, opening the horizon to a variety of ground-breaking applications. By equipping nanodevices with wireless communications capabilities, nanotechnology will facilitate the advance of multiple disruptive applications, such as in-body communication, software-defined metamaterials and metasurfaces, wireless robotic materials, and on-chip communication. Enabling the above applications will require a broad range of expertise, ranging from nanoscale hardware design, resource-constrained computing, and channel modelling to different layers of nanonetworks' protocol development, as well as the expertise along the four detected promising application domains.  


The First ACM International Workshop on Nanoscale Computing, Communication, and Applications (ACM NanoCoCoA 2020) will be held in conjunction with the The 18th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2020) on November 16, 2020.

In today’s scenario, each individual faces substantial complications relating to transportation systems such as congestion, vehicle parking difficulties, pollution caused by an increased level of carbon dioxide emission, longer traveling times, road accidents, etc. These consequences are due to the rising number of vehicular systems and rapid urbanization processes. This leads to the development of modern technologies such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANET), VANET cloud (VC), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Among all these techniques, IoV remains the most prominent and emerging one. IoV is a series of interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other through a common public network. It is a highly integrated application of two major domains IoT and ITS. The communication across the IoV network includes three different types: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P).  


Smart vehicles with progressive communication abilities do not only communicate with broadcast and navigation satellites but also with various smart devices such as roadside units, smart vehicles, and passenger smartphones. Since IoV has widespread interconnected networks with numerous users, there is an increased risk of security and privacy measures. These security and privacy concerns may lead to serious consequences if they are not addressed and dealt with in an appropriate manner. Thus, advanced security measures for IoV systems have become the most essential requirement.  


This special issue focuses mainly on the development of various cybersecurity mechanisms for IoV systems with improved security and privacy features. Further, it seeks to bring together the various researchers and industry people from different fields of computer science to contribute novel and effective cyber-security solutions for security protection in IoV systems.  


Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:  


Security and Privacy in IoV using cyber-security mechanisms  
Enhanced cybersecurity mechanisms for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication in IoV  
Novel and efficient frameworks for improving trust based secure communication in IoV  
Secure Cloud assisted cyber-security mechanisms for IoV  
Trust based security algorithms for Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV)  
Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV): Architecture, security, privacy and future directions  
Security protocols for various applications of IoV using cyber-security  
Protection and management of cyber-security across critical IoV systems  
Secure Authentication and access control mechanisms for IoV using cybersecurity  
Novel and improved cybersecurity solutions for IoV in smart cities

Special Issue Information  


Dear Colleagues,  


Information hiding techniques and network covert channels are becoming  
fundamental to assess the security characteristics of the Internet. On  
the one hand, they can be used as offensive tools to empower malware,  
for instance, to bypass security policies of infected nodes, to secretly  
exfiltrate data towards remote command and control facilities, or to  
orchestrate a botnet or launch an attack without being detected by  
de-facto standard security tools. On the other hand, information hiding  
and network covert channels can be used to enforce copyright of digital  
artifacts via watermarking, trace network flows for traffic engineering  
purposes, and implement privacy enhancing services. From this  
perspective, this Special Issue aims at collecting new work addressing  
different aspects of information hiding and network covert channels.  


Authors are invited to submit original work on (but not limited to) the  
following topics:  


Model detection techniques and the mitigation of information  
hiding-capable threats;  
Colluding application attacks and exfiltration techniques;  
New mechanisms to orchestrate botnets and hide data exfiltration;  
Novel detection techniques for network covert channels, with an emphasis  
on scalability;  
Advanced network covert channels, for instance, those leveraging  
reversible steganographic methods;  
Information hiding for obfuscation, anti-forensics techniques, and  
covert data storage;  
Watermarking of network flows for traffic engineering and security;  
Privacy enhancing frameworks based on information hiding.

Background  


With the digital revolution, edge analytics along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become important parts of our lives and are getting tremendous attention from industry, academia, governments, and from the smart connected living community as a whole. The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the true vision of the connected world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected living services, computation becomes more intensive and storage burden increases at each edge device. To address these challenges, AI-powered edge computing provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, at a level that is impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-AI (edge analytics driven by AI) has the capability to self-learn from data, understand patterns, optimize, make predictions, and provide fresh insights to stakeholders of connected living for better decisions with improved Quality of Services (QoS). Even though researchers have been making advances in AI and edge data analytics individually, relatively less attention has been given to build a cost-effective edge-AI driven connected living ecosystem while considering many aspects of its algorithms, communications, offloading, caching, architectures, framework, and services. Even today, many technical challenges need to be addressed in this convergence of edge-AI driven connected living paradigm.  


The aim of this special issue is to bring academic researchers and industry developers together for sharing the recent advances and future trends of AI-driven edge intelligence for connected living. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


Explainable AI (XAI) and predictive edge analytics for infectious diseases such as COVID-19  
Edge AI-assisted COVID-19 and similar infectious disease detection or diagnosis systems  
AI-centric Mobile Edge Computing approach for Connected Living  
AI-enabled IoT-edge data analytics for Connected Living  
AI-enabled edge data fusion for Connected Living  
ML-driven edge approach to Connected Living  
AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning based networked applications, techniques and testbeds for Connected Living  
AI-driven multi access edge computing approach for Connected Living  
New opportunities, challenges, case studies, and applications of Edge-AI for Connected Living  
Security, Privacy, and Trust of Edge-AI for Connected Living

IEEE TNSM SPECIAL ISSUE ON LATEST DEVELOPMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF NETWORKS AND SERVICES  
[https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp)  


-----------------------------------  


Submission Deadline: October 15, 2020  


Dear Colleagues:  


We cordially invite you to share your latest research results by submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management Special Issue on "Latest Developments for Security Management of Networks and Services".  


------------------------  
CALL FOR PAPERS  
------------------------  


As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.  


These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.  


IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services. We welcome submissions addressing the important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!

Journal of Network and Systems Management - Springer  


Special issue on  


Cybersecurity Management in the era of AI  


[https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838](https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838)  


***Submissions due: October 31st, 2020***  


We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.  


Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.  


Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.  


This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI.

Software: Practice and Experience  


50th Anniversary (Golden Jubilee) Celebration  
Special Issue on:  
Software Systems and Innovations Journey from 1970-2020  


[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1097024x)  


=========================================================================  


Call for Papers:  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------  


The first issue of "Software: Practice and Experience", published in  
1971, reported on applications that could be described in a few thousand  
lines of code; today, software systems are among the most complex  
entities produced by humans. This growth has spawned new development  
methodologies and exposed serious systemic weaknesses.  


Over the last 50 years, our most pressing problems have moved from the  
seven development issues that David Barron focused on in his inaugural  
editorial to issues brought about by the scope and ubiquity of our  
current applications: Software systems must now be resistant to attack  
by malicious agents, and must operate successfully with improper inputs.  
Cyber-physical systems must avoid entering states that would damage  
equipment or harm people. Applications built as a collection of  
cooperating processes must be able to deliver results in a timely  
manner, even when the number of simultaneous users fluctuates  
significantly. Whether or not these issues can be dealt with by current  
design methodology is an open question. Regardless of the answer,  
however, Barron's vision for the journal as a venue for authors to  
present their work in a form that will be useful to others remains valid  
as we move into the next 50 years.  


We invite high quality papers that discuss the development of new ideas,  
models, paradigms, and systems evolution appropriate to the challenges  
facing the field today. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
* Threat models for software systems  
* Performance improvement in distributed systems  
* Scalability of software  
* User interface design  
* Workflow management  
* Application Programming Models and Environments  
* Advances in systems software powering embedded devices to  
large-scale computing environments  
* Internet-driven Innovative Applications

IMPORTANT DATES  
----------------------  
Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.  


SCOPE AND TOPICS  
----------------------  
During the last decade, 5G technology has been developed and successfully commercialized for mobile communication networks. 5G technology supports enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication, massive machine type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT), devices and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical devices with IMT-2020 standard aims.  


Some key technologies, such as 5G numerology with new radio (NR) waveform in sub- or above 6 GHz (mmWave) bands and MIMO with beamforming, allow those heterogeneous devices or services to overcome their own challenging scenarios. Still, 5G access technology has further challenges, as it is now evolving with convergence technologies, such as autonomously driven vehicles, smart factories, satellite or UAS, public safety, etc. This 5G+ demands more bandwidth, connectivity, and reliability.  


Wireless communications in the Terahertz (THz) frequency band and unlicensed bands such as private 5G are considered to provide ultra-high user data rates. Further, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been explored for spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. V2X communication using mmWave side-links is not under-standardized. 5G and 6G now consider interoperation of GEO or LEO satellites and UAS to control autonomous vehicles, including drones, and provide wide-area cells for public safety or content broadcast. This nationwide cell can improve reliability and service continuity. As 5G+ pursues more than low-latency end-to-end access delay (<1 ms), mobile edge computing (MEC) has received attention in terms of supporting the requirements of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) to improve performance.  


This Special Issue will present the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 5G access communication and its evolution. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit their original manuscripts.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- Sub- or above 6 GHz radio access technologies for 5G+  
- V2X communication using mmWave links  
- NOMA for 5G and beyond wireless networks  
- THz communications for 5G+ eMBB  
- Fog and MEC architecture for 5G access networks  
- Machine learning aided Fog and MEC operation  
- (Massive) multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) for a 5G+ access network  
- Network function virtualization (NFV) and hardware acceleration for data plane processing of 5G access traffic  
- Traffic measurements and analysis (control and data plane) of 5G access networks  
- SDN-assisted control plane in 5G access networks  
- Multi-connectivity and co-existence in satellite/UAS and a 5G network  
- Private 5G access network by dynamic spectrum access (DSA)  
- Localization issue in indoor or city canyon

Dear colleagues  


Please, consider submitting a paper to the Special Issue "Spatio-Temporal Models and Geo-Technologies"  
of the ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information (see motivations and topics of interest below).  


Deadline for manuscript submissions: 15 December 2020.

-------------  


Motivations  
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.  


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:  


- Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;  


- Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;  


- Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;  


- Graph-based representations to space and time phenomena;  


- Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning;  


- Multiscale modelling;  


- Combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;  


- Spatiotemporal query languages within GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal GIS interfaces;  


- Temporal indoor GIS;  


- Location-based time GIS;  


- Real-time GIS;  


- Temporal web and wireless GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal technologies;  


- Spatiotemporal urban and environmental GIS;  


- Spatiotemporal semantic web;  


- Spatiotemporal data mining.

MDPI Drones - Special Issue  


Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms  


Submission Deadline: 31 December 2020  


[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/SwarmFEC)  






Dear Colleagues,  


In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.  


This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.  


Possible topics include but are not limited to:  


Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;  
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;  
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;  
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;

Special Issue Information  


The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network connecting billions of  
physical objects and devices that are capable of sensing and sharing  
data between themselves and the Internet. Hence, one of the core goals  
of an IoT system is to provide a digital overlay of information over the  
physical world, in domains such as industries, smart cities,  
transportation, and energy. Thus, sensing and embedded systems are key  
enabling technologies for the IoT vision.  


The increasing popularity of IoT applications is driving an exponential  
growth in connected IoT devices and generated data. As a result, the  
current IoT system architectures and communication technologies are  
facing significant technical challenges to meet the requirements of  
connectivity, scalability, and interoperability, as well as to  
efficiently support the transmission and processing of large volumes of  
data. Hence, there is a need for new enabling technologies, end-to-end  
architectures, and data management platforms. This Special Issue aims to  
foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas,  
approaches, theories, and practice to resolve the challenging issues  
related to the development of IoT ecosystems. Comprehensive review  
papers on the emerging research trends in the IoT domain are highly  
encouraged.  


This special issue belongs to the section “Internet of Things”. Topics  
of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


- Sensor technologies and protocols for IoT systems  
- IoT technologies and wireless sensor networks for smart cities and  
smart homes  
- IoT in 5G and beyond 5G networks  
- Edge, fog, and cloud computing architectures for IoT systems  
- SDN and NFV solutions for IoT systems  
- Mission-critical IoT applications like smart grid, healthcare,  
connected vehicles, and so on  
- Security, privacy, and trust management in IoT  
- IoT solutions for crowdsourcing and crowd-sensing
