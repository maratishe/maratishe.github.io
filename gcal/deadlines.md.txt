MDPI Sensors - Special Issue  
New Approaches for Services and Information Delivery over Novel Vehicular Networks  


https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Novelr_Vehicular_Networks  


CALL FOR PAPERS  
As a consequence of the improvement in the performance of onboard devices, the improvement in batteries, or the notorious increase in service demands, autonomous vehicles (such as unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, UAV, or UGV) have turned out to be flexible multi-mission multi-sensorized network platforms with autonomous inter-connection capabilities. They can be linked using multi-hop networks naturally evolving the traditional concept of MANETs (mobile ad hoc networks) into FANETs (flying mobile ad hoc networks) or VANETs (vehicular mobile ad hoc networks), with new requirements and challenges.  


On top of these interconnection facilities, new enabling technologies, such as NFV or SDN, are evolving towards flexible service provisioning scenarios, where virtualization and softwarization paradigms have been radically adopted, and new promising use-cases are emerging day in and day out, facilitating service and information delivery in many different areas over heterogeneous networking environments.  


Reviews, original research articles, and practical experiences will be published. Reviews should provide an up-to-date, well-balanced overview of the current state-of-the-art, and include the main results from different research groups.  


TOPICS OF INTEREST  
Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  
+ Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)  
+ Mobile/vehicular/flying ad hoc networks (MANET/VANET/FANET)  
+ Network functions virtualization (NFV)  
+ Software defined networking (SDN)  
+ Internet of things (IoT)  
+ Data-centric approaches, e.g., the data distribution service (DDS)  
+ Application/transport/network layer protocols in MANET, VANET, and FANET environments  
+ Enablers for lightweight virtual network functions  


IMPORTANT DATES  
Submission Deadline: 15 July 2020.

Special Issue Information  


Dear Colleagues,  


Information hiding techniques and network covert channels are becoming  
fundamental to assess the security characteristics of the Internet. On  
the one hand, they can be used as offensive tools to empower malware,  
for instance, to bypass security policies of infected nodes, to secretly  
exfiltrate data towards remote command and control facilities, or to  
orchestrate a botnet or launch an attack without being detected by  
de-facto standard security tools. On the other hand, information hiding  
and network covert channels can be used to enforce copyright of digital  
artifacts via watermarking, trace network flows for traffic engineering  
purposes, and implement privacy enhancing services. From this  
perspective, this Special Issue aims at collecting new work addressing  
different aspects of information hiding and network covert channels.  


Authors are invited to submit original work on (but not limited to) the  
following topics:  


Model detection techniques and the mitigation of information  
hiding-capable threats;  
Colluding application attacks and exfiltration techniques;  
New mechanisms to orchestrate botnets and hide data exfiltration;  
Novel detection techniques for network covert channels, with an emphasis  
on scalability;  
Advanced network covert channels, for instance, those leveraging  
reversible steganographic methods;  
Information hiding for obfuscation, anti-forensics techniques, and  
covert data storage;  
Watermarking of network flows for traffic engineering and security;  
Privacy enhancing frameworks based on information hiding.

sCOPE  






Urban IoT promises to deliver massive amounts of data and fundamentally change our understanding of these systems. This should have a very positive impact in the operation of many urban services, and lead to more resource-efficient and affordable infrastructures.  


However, the deployment of cutting edge IoT technology is not a solution just by itself. Its success depends on the ability to integrate the city fabric and become an integral part of urban services across multiple areas, such as mobility, buildings, utility, public safety, healthcare or education.  


Also, taking in consideration the recent COVID-19 pandemic, visions and challenges for smart cities are now being greatly and dynamically influenced and changed. In this context, Urb-IoT 2020 also welcomes ambitious papers such as visioning or recent data analysis papers that reflect current world issues.  


We are pleased to invite you to submit your paper to Urb-IoT 2020. Submissions should be in English, following the Springer formatting guidelines (see Submission).

Dear Colleagues,  


I would be glad if you, and others from your Research Group, would accept the invitation to contribute to:  


Special Issue: "Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) Communication”  
Information Journal - ISSN:2078-2489 (Scopus, SCImago)  
Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 July 2020  


Dear Colleagues,  


The growing number of moving vehicles, motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians, mainly in the urban environment, leads to an increased number of accidents, traffic jams, and to higher levels of energy consumption and pollution. Traffic accidents take thousands of lives each year and cause critical injuries to millions of persons; nevertheless, vehicles, as standalone machines, are getting safer, more efficient, more comfortable, and providing an overall better user experience, with increasing levels of automation.  


Vehicles use on-board communication units in order to exchange data with each other and with any infrastructural support, by means of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) interactions, generically classified as “Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication”.  


V2X communication systems enable information sharing and usage of cooperative approaches in order to increase road safety, avoid accidents and traffic congestions, give priority to emergency vehicles, and also cope with vulnerable road users. New and challenging V2X research issues arise from recent technologic developments, allowing the growth of either assisted or autonomous driving modes.  


This Special Issue on “Vehicle-To-Everything Communication” is aimed at recent research findings, coming both from industry and academic R&D, with important contributions to ITS application development, either at safety, efficiency, management, and comfort or infotainment areas. The key areas of this Special Issue include but are not limited to:  


- V2X for cooperative and autonomous driving;  


- cellular V2X communications;  


- V2X for extended sensing and autonomous awareness;  


- V2X for emergency vehicles;  


- V2X for smart mobility;  


- V2X modeling and testing; safety, security, and privacy in V2X;  


- connected vehicles and vulnerable road users;  


- simulation platforms for V2X;  


- new vehicular network architectures;  


- named data networks for connected vehicles.

In today’s scenario, each individual faces substantial complications relating to transportation systems such as congestion, vehicle parking difficulties, pollution caused by an increased level of carbon dioxide emission, longer traveling times, road accidents, etc. These consequences are due to the rising number of vehicular systems and rapid urbanization processes. This leads to the development of modern technologies such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANET), VANET cloud (VC), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Among all these techniques, IoV remains the most prominent and emerging one. IoV is a series of interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other through a common public network. It is a highly integrated application of two major domains IoT and ITS. The communication across the IoV network includes three different types: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P).  


Smart vehicles with progressive communication abilities do not only communicate with broadcast and navigation satellites but also with various smart devices such as roadside units, smart vehicles, and passenger smartphones. Since IoV has widespread interconnected networks with numerous users, there is an increased risk of security and privacy measures. These security and privacy concerns may lead to serious consequences if they are not addressed and dealt with in an appropriate manner. Thus, advanced security measures for IoV systems have become the most essential requirement.  


This special issue focuses mainly on the development of various cybersecurity mechanisms for IoV systems with improved security and privacy features. Further, it seeks to bring together the various researchers and industry people from different fields of computer science to contribute novel and effective cyber-security solutions for security protection in IoV systems.  


Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:  


Security and Privacy in IoV using cyber-security mechanisms  
Enhanced cybersecurity mechanisms for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) communication in IoV  
Novel and efficient frameworks for improving trust based secure communication in IoV  
Secure Cloud assisted cyber-security mechanisms for IoV  
Trust based security algorithms for Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV)  
Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV): Architecture, security, privacy and future directions  
Security protocols for various applications of IoV using cyber-security  
Protection and management of cyber-security across critical IoV systems  
Secure Authentication and access control mechanisms for IoV using cybersecurity  
Novel and improved cybersecurity solutions for IoV in smart cities

Special Issue Information  


Dear Colleagues,  


Information hiding techniques and network covert channels are becoming  
fundamental to assess the security characteristics of the Internet. On  
the one hand, they can be used as offensive tools to empower malware,  
for instance, to bypass security policies of infected nodes, to secretly  
exfiltrate data towards remote command and control facilities, or to  
orchestrate a botnet or launch an attack without being detected by  
de-facto standard security tools. On the other hand, information hiding  
and network covert channels can be used to enforce copyright of digital  
artifacts via watermarking, trace network flows for traffic engineering  
purposes, and implement privacy enhancing services. From this  
perspective, this Special Issue aims at collecting new work addressing  
different aspects of information hiding and network covert channels.  


Authors are invited to submit original work on (but not limited to) the  
following topics:  


Model detection techniques and the mitigation of information  
hiding-capable threats;  
Colluding application attacks and exfiltration techniques;  
New mechanisms to orchestrate botnets and hide data exfiltration;  
Novel detection techniques for network covert channels, with an emphasis  
on scalability;  
Advanced network covert channels, for instance, those leveraging  
reversible steganographic methods;  
Information hiding for obfuscation, anti-forensics techniques, and  
covert data storage;  
Watermarking of network flows for traffic engineering and security;  
Privacy enhancing frameworks based on information hiding.

Background  


With the digital revolution, edge analytics along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become important parts of our lives and are getting tremendous attention from industry, academia, governments, and from the smart connected living community as a whole. The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the true vision of the connected world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected living services, computation becomes more intensive and storage burden increases at each edge device. To address these challenges, AI-powered edge computing provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, at a level that is impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-AI (edge analytics driven by AI) has the capability to self-learn from data, understand patterns, optimize, make predictions, and provide fresh insights to stakeholders of connected living for better decisions with improved Quality of Services (QoS). Even though researchers have been making advances in AI and edge data analytics individually, relatively less attention has been given to build a cost-effective edge-AI driven connected living ecosystem while considering many aspects of its algorithms, communications, offloading, caching, architectures, framework, and services. Even today, many technical challenges need to be addressed in this convergence of edge-AI driven connected living paradigm.  


The aim of this special issue is to bring academic researchers and industry developers together for sharing the recent advances and future trends of AI-driven edge intelligence for connected living. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:  


Explainable AI (XAI) and predictive edge analytics for infectious diseases such as COVID-19  
Edge AI-assisted COVID-19 and similar infectious disease detection or diagnosis systems  
AI-centric Mobile Edge Computing approach for Connected Living  
AI-enabled IoT-edge data analytics for Connected Living  
AI-enabled edge data fusion for Connected Living  
ML-driven edge approach to Connected Living  
AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning based networked applications, techniques and testbeds for Connected Living  
AI-driven multi access edge computing approach for Connected Living  
New opportunities, challenges, case studies, and applications of Edge-AI for Connected Living  
Security, Privacy, and Trust of Edge-AI for Connected Living

CALL FOR PAPERS  
IEEE TNSM SPECIAL ISSUE ON LATEST DEVELOPMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF NETWORKS AND SERVICES  
https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm/cfp  


-----------------------------------  


Submission Deadline: October 15, 2020  


Dear Colleagues:  


We cordially invite you to share your latest research results by submitting your manuscript to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management Special Issue on "Latest Developments for Security Management of Networks and Services".  


------------------------  
CALL FOR PAPERS  
------------------------  


As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.  


These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.  


IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services.

Journal of Network and Systems Management - Springer  


Special issue on  


Cybersecurity Management in the era of AI  


https://www.springer.com/journal/10922/updates/17974838  


***Submissions due: October 31st, 2020***  


We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.  


Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.  


Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.  


This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI.
