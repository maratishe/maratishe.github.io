Dear Dr. Zhanikeev,

The journal Sustainability (ISSN 2071-1050, IF 2.576) is currently running a Special Issue entitled "Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction Development". Prof. Dr. Silvia Mirri and Prof. Dr. Catia Prandi are serving as Guest Editors for this issue. We think you could make an excellent contribution based on your expertise and your following paper:

The Last Man Standing Technique for Proof-of-Location in IoT Infrastructures at Network Edge. WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING 2019, 0, 7317019.

This Special Issue will contribute to an integrated understanding of the relevance of HCI methodologies and practices in the design and development of sustainable infrastructures and tools, engaging communities and stakeholders, in critical initiatives to foster sustainable development. Contributors from different fields are invited to submit their articles on this topic, presenting how HCI researchers and practitioners can contribute to the broader research on developing sustainability.

For further reading, please follow the link to the Special Issue Website at: https://www.mdpi.com/si/sustainability/Human_Computer_Interaction_Development

The submission deadline is 10 May 2021. You may send your manuscript now or up until the deadline. Submitted papers should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. We also encourage authors to send a short abstract or tentative title to the Editorial Office in advance (sustainability@mdpi.com).

Sustainability is fully open access. Open access (unlimited and free access by readers) increases publicity and promotes more frequent citations, as indicated by several studies. Open access is supported by the authors and their institutes. An Article Processing Charge (APC) of CHF 1800 currently applies to all accepted papers.

For further details on the submission process, please see the instructions for authors at the journal website (http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/instructions).

We also invite you to post an early version of your paper on our free preprint platform, Preprints, allowing you to receive feedback from your peers and make your early results citable. For more information or to submit your preprint, visit https://www.preprints.org/how_it_works.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
