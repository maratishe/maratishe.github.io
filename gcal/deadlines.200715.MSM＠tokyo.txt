IEEEMSN 2020 provides a forum for academic researchers and industry practitionersto present research progresses, exchange new ideas, and identify futuredirections in the field of Mobility, Sensing and Networking. From this year,with the technology advancement and the success of previous editions of MSN,the name of conference is changed from “International Conference on MobileAd-hoc and Sensor Networks” to “International Conference on Mobility, Sensingand Networking”.

 

Scopeand Objectives

Mobility,sensing and networking are the key areas of enabling technologies for thenext-generation networks, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. Recentyears have witnessed the increasing convergence of algorithms, protocols, andapplications for mobility, sensing and networking in a range of applicationsincluding connected vehicles, smart cities, industries, and smart health.Building on the past 15 years of success, the 16th International Conference onMobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2020) provides a forum for academicresearchers and industry practitioners to exchange new research ideas, presenttheir progress, and identify future directions in the field of mobility,sensing and networking.
