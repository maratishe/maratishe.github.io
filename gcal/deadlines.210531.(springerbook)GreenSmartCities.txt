Dear colleague,

We are editing a Springer Book entitled “Computational Intelligence Techniques for Green Smart Cities”. The Book will be indexed by Scopus and ISI.

I cordially invite you to contribute a chapter. The full chapter is due later this year but for now, I will just need the following:

- Author List
- Chapter Title
- Abstract (between 2 and 6 sentences)

The tentative structure of the book is mentioned below:

PART 1: Green Smart Education

Chapter 1. Machine learning for green smart education

Chapter 2. Deep learning for green smart education

Chapter 3. Evolutionary algorithms for green smart education

Chapter 4. Green Smart learning solutions for  combating Covid-19



PART 2: Green Smart Health

Chapter 5. Machine learning for green smart health

Chapter 6. Deep learning for green smart health

Chapter 7. Evolutionary algorithms for green smart health

Chapter 8. Green Smart health solutions for  combating Covid-19



PART 3: Green Smart transportation

Chapter 9. Machine learning for green smart transportation

Chapter 10. Deep learning for green smart transportation

Chapter 11. Evolutionary algorithms for green smart transportation

Chapter 12. Green Smart transportation solutions for  combating Covid-19



PART 4: Green Smart Environment

Chapter 13. Machine learning for green smart environment

Chapter 14. Deep learning for green smart environment

Chapter 15. Evolutionary algorithms for green smart environment

Chapter 16. Green Smart environment solutions for  combating Covid-19



Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Feel free to share with your network as well.
