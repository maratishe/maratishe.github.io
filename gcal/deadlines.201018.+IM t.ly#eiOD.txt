===============================  Overview ======================================
Call for Papers

The 17th IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management (IM
2021) will be held on May 17-21, 2021, in Bordeaux, France. Held in odd-numbered
years since 1989, IM 2021 follows the 33 years tradition of NOMS and IM as the
primary IEEE Communications Society√≠s forum for technical exchange on management
of information and communication technology focusing on research, development,
integration, standards, service provisioning, and user communities. IM 2021 will
focus on the theme of "Intelligent Management of Open and Highly Programmable
Networks".

It aims to capture recent results, emerging approaches and technical
solutions for dealing with resilience and sustainability of network and service
management in highly dynamic environments. Furthermore, the sudden and important
uptake of work-from-home and the promise of the post-digital era are rising new
challenges and exacerbating the dynamic nature of the communication
infrastructure, pushing additional requirements on networks in terms of quality,
resilience and sustainability. This is also accelerating the adoption of
Artificial Intelligence advances along with the openness and programmability of
network infrastructures, to make these more flexible and adaptive. In addition
to this theme, IM 2021 will cover a wide range of topics of interest within the
field in integrated network and service management.

IM 2021 will offer five types of sessions: technical, experience, poster, panel
and dissertation. High quality will be assured through a well-qualified
Technical Program Committee and stringent peer review of paper submissions. A
special call for demonstrations is organized to allow industry partners and
researchers to demonstrate early products and prototypes.


========================= Submission Instructions ==============================

Authors are invited to submit original contributions written in English
that have not been  published or submitted for publication elsewhere.
Technical papers must be  formatted using the IEEE 2-column format and
not exceed 8 pages (excluding references) for full paper submissions or
not exceed 4 pages (excluding references) for poster/short paper
submissions. All papers should be submitted through the JEMS conference
submission system.

All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted and presented
papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted
to IEEE Xplore.
