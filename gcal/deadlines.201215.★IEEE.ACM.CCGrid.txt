Call For Papers

The 21st IEEE/ACM international Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and
Internet Computing (CCGrid 2021) is a leading forum to disseminate and
discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in
distributed systems, ranging from computing Clusters to widely
distributed Clouds and emerging Internet computing paradigms such as
Fog/Edge Computing for Internet of Things (IoT)/Big Data applications.
The conference features keynotes, technical presentations, posters,
workshops, tutorials, as well as the SCALE challenge featuring live
demonstrations and the ICFEC 2021 conference.

In 2021, IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021 will be ‘self-colocated’ with its
postponed 2020 edition, in Melbourne, Australia. We will jointly
celebrate the 20th and 21st anniversary of the conference !

We solicit original contributions on all aspects of distributed systems
and applications in the context of Cluster, Cloud, and Internet
computing environments. Specific topics of interest include but are not
limited to the following:

Internet Computing Frontiers: Edge, Fog, Serverless, Lambda, Streaming,
Highly decentralized approaches to cloud computing. Edge/Fog computing,
sensor data streaming and computation on the edges of the network.
Function as a Service (Faas), Backend as a Service (BaaS), serverless
computing, lambda computing.

Architecture, Networking, Data Centers: Service oriented architectures.
Utility computing models. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, *aaS paradigms. Service
composition and orchestration. Software-Defined Network-enabled Systems.
Micro-datacenter, cloudlet, edge, or fog computing infrastructure.
Virtualized hardware: GPUs, tensor processing units, FPGAs.

Storage and I/O Systems: Distributed storage, cloud storage, Storage as
a Service, data locality techniques for in-memory processing, storage in
the edge.

Programming Models and Runtime Systems: Programming models, languages,
systems and tools/environments. Virtualization, containers, and
middleware technologies. Actors, agents, programming decentralized
computing systems.

Resource Management and Scheduling: Resource allocation algorithms,
profiling, modeling. Cluster, cloud, and internet computing scheduling
and meta-scheduling techniques.

Performance Modelling and Evaluation: Performance models. Monitoring and
evaluation tools. Analysis of system/application performance.

Cyber-Security, Privacy and Resilient Distributed Systems: Distributed
Systems security and trust. Access control. Data privacy and integrity.
Regulation. Resiliency of service attacks.

Sustainable and Green Computing: Environment friendly computing
ecosystems. Hardware/software/application energy efficiency. Power,
cooling and thermal awareness.

Applications: Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
Cyber-Physical Systems, e-Health, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Smart
Systems and Applications.
