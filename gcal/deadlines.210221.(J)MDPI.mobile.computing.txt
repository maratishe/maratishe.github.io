Scope:
======

In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new
path rearrangements.

This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.


The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:

Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;
Complex systems and networks;
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;
Simulation of mobile network structures;
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.
