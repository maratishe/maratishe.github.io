Call for Paper
With the rapid development of computing and communication technologies, many applications have facilitated a dramatic growth of new techniques’ implementations, such as Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, big data, pervasive computing, Internet of Things, and smart city systems. Enabling a smart life has become a popular research topic with an urgent demand. Therefore, the 5th International Conference on Smart Computing and Communication (SmartCom 2020) will focus on both smart computing and communications fields and aims to collect recent academic work to improve the research and practical applications.

The scope of SmartCom 2020 covers a broad extent, from Artificial Intelligence to smart communications, from smart computing to smart city. The conference is gathering all high-quality research/industrial papers related to smart computing and communications and targets at proposing a reference guideline for further research. SmartCom 2020 will be held in Paris, France and its conference proceedings publisher is Springer.

Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:
Artificial Intelligence enhanced smart computing
Smart computing in smart city
