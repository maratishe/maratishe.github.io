*******************************************

IEEE LANMAN has an established tradition as a forum for presenting and
discussing the latest technical advances in local and metropolitan area
networking. Cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation
are solicited in all areas of networking. In keeping with the heritage of
the symposium, there will be a central theme, and in 2021 the theme is
“Networking in the New Normal.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world to a new normal. Not only are
research, business, education, and entertainment being shifted online, but
also many of our daily activities are.  Recent technological advances in
networking present unique opportunities to bring us to this new normal.  At
the same time, they still pose numerous challenges to be addressed, such as
scalable and pervasive connectivity, sustainable networking, and new
application paradigms for online activities.

The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages stimulating
exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be a forum for
discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network access protocols,
network management and control, services and applications. Speculative and
potentially transformative ideas are particularly encouraged, as are
studies reporting measurements from real-life networks and testbeds. Papers
are solicited on any topic in networking, including, but not limited to:

Networking for online education and entertainment
Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs
Machine-to-machine communication
Cloud, edge and fog computing integration
Co-existence and heterogeneity support at the edge (HetNets)
Energy efficiency for local and metropolitan area networking
5G and 6G localization, device-free localization, and privacy-aware
localization
Information security for local and metropolitan area networking
Intelligent routing, forwarding, and scheduling
Named data networking
Network and transport mechanisms for latency reduction
Network virtualization in local and metropolitan areas
Performance and reliability of local and metropolitan area networks
Software-defined networking in local and metropolitan areas

IEEE LANMAN 2021 solicits paper submissions of papers up to 6 pages. Some
regular paper submissions may be accepted as short papers (2 pages) by the
TPC. The page limits include all figures, tables, and references. All
papers must be electronically submitted in PDF according to the guidelines
in the symposium website  https://lanman2021.ieee-lanman.org/. The
proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore and will include both short
and regular papers presented at the symposium. A best paper award will be
awarded.
