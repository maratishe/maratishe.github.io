Scope and Topics of Interest

There have been unprecedented advances in developing technologies to
enable the next generation networks, which will seamlessly integrate the
computing equipment with networking to provide the computing-harvesting
next generation services. Thanks to the huge enhancement of computing
processor and interface architectures, communication networks can now
handle network functions implemented as virtualized machines making
large use of software elements. Communication devices can now host very
advanced applications, and data centers can be pervasively distributed
down to network access points. Networks, applications and clouds control
layers can so leverage on advanced decision-making solutions to target
full automation in Internet and next-generation service delivery. In
addition, quantum Internet is emerging with vast amount of computing
power, which opens new possibilities. This trend also greatly affects
next-generation broadband wireless networks, such as spectrum efficiency,
energy efficiency, and mobility management. The NGNI symposium welcomes
original research work in technical areas focusing on the innovations on
next-generation networks.

The Next-Generation Networking and Internet (NGNI) Symposium seeks
original contributions in the following topical areas, plus others that
are not explicitly listed but are closely related to:
•    Addressing and naming with the presence of mobility and portability
•    Centralized-RAN, Cloud-RAN, and Fog-RAN architectures
•    Cloud-based and fog-based networking
