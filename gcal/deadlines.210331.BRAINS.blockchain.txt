This includes finance and payments (e.g., fintech), but also networks (e.g.,  power
grids or telecom networks), computing (e.g., brokering of edge resources) , IoT (e.g., supply chain, V2X or industry 4.0) or service platforms (e.g.,
identity management). BRAINS Conference is dedicated to these new advances that  could make the world of networks and services more secure, while enabling
disruptive new distributed business models.

- Tradeoffs between decentralization, scalability, performance and
security
- Protocols and algorithms

Decentralized Apps, Smart contracts and chain code
- Development languages and tooling
- Security, Privacy, Attacks, Forensics
- Transaction Monitoring and Analysis
- Token Economy
- Distributed Trust
- Collaboration between on-chain and off-chain code
