===========================

The organizing team is closely monitoring the development of the COVID-19 situation. In case of travel restrictions that prohibit physical attendance, the conference will be held in an alternative way using distance presentations in order to ensure both the safety of participants and wide dissemination.

Aims and Scope

Nowadays, the global vision is the progressive migration towards smart cities in order to enhance the citizen life and to encounter many problems induced by population growth and increased urbanization, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, ... These smart environments can be viewed as interconnection of wide-scale cyber-physical systems, with sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators to collect diverse information from the surrounding environment and with actuators dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. Through such systems, many innovative applications can be proposed in several fields of activity, such as smart living, smart mobility, smart economy, smart environment and smart governance.  As the human factor is involved in many applications, verifying and proving the validity and correctness of protocols and applications are crucial steps before deployment, in addition to ensuring other paradigms such as scalability, energy saving, resource constraints, etc. In this context, several methods and approaches of Distributed Computing are exploited in software and hardware to propose new approaches able to support and analyse the huge amount of collected information and to deal with the control of these emerging networks.

The workshop aims to be a major forum for researchers and practitioners, interested in the design, development and evaluation of distributed systems, platforms and architectures for Cyber Physical Systems in the context of smart cities. Highlights of the workshop will include a high quality single-track technical program and an invited speaker.
