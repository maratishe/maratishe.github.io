## MOTIVATION AND RATIONALE
The conference will focus on the application of IT technologies to
social good. Social good is typically defined as an action that provides
some sort of benefit to the general public. In this case, Internet
connection, education, and healthcare are all good examples of social
goods. However, new media innovations and the explosion of online
communities have added new meaning to the term. Social good is now about
global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals,
technology, and collaboration to create positive societal impact.
