**** Aims and Scope ****

It is undeniable that the cities' urbanisation has modernised people's
lives, bringing several benefits to the population. However, it has also
brought serious challenges such as public management of collective
spaces, air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and
quality of life. In this context, Urban Computing emerges as a process
of acquisition, integration, and analysis of a large volume of
heterogeneous data generated from different sources in urban spaces,
such as portable devices, sensors, vehicles, humans, among others. Urban
Computing is an interdisciplinary area that connects information and
communication technology, advanced management of large volumes of data,
and diverse data analysis methods to propose solutions to problems faced
by cities. In addition, Urban Computing seeks to understand the nature
of urban and social phenomena to better plan the future of cities and
improve their inhabitants' quality of life.

UrbCom aims to create a space for: (1) presentation and discussion of
studies in the area of Urban Computing; (2) collaboration between
researchers from different areas that, given the interdisciplinary
nature, is not limited to Computer Science.
