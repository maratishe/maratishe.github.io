Scope and topics of the workshop:

Today’s, intelligent systems are a core building block in smart cities transportation through which smart, reliable, safe, and efficient integrated transportation solutions are provided. Intelligent systems management integrated with today’s advanced vehicular and wireless network technologies, such as autonomous and connected vehicles, will play a crucial role in improving the quality and delivery performance of diversified vehicular services. Many unprecedented challenges arise from the emerging autonomous and connected vehicle technologies. These include configuring vehicular cloud services to user requirements, vehicle security issues related to connectivity, big data analytics for intelligent transportation, and user’s trust in such technology as one of the issues facing implementation and deployment of an autonomous vehicle. There is also a need for customized computation and communication technology for the integrated solutions of autonomous vehicles and smart city sub-systems. The aim of the Fourth International Workshop on Intelligent Transportation and Autonomous Vehicles Technologies is to bring together engineers, researchers, and practitioners interested in the advances and applications in the field of intelligent transportation and autonomous vehicle technologies. Participants are invited to present and discuss recent developments and challenges in autonomous vehicle systems. This version of this workshop focuses on innovative applications, tools and frameworks in technology areas related to the intelligent management of driving and in dynamic networks. Papers describing original novel work and advanced prototypes, systems and tools are encouraged.
