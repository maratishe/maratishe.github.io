INTSYS 2020 is part of the 6th annual Smart City 360˚Summit, promoting multidisciplinary scientific collaboration to solve complex societal, technological and economic problems of emerging Smart Cities. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are receiving increased attention as an answer to the need of innovative solutions to tackle safety, coordination and efficiency challenges related to transportation modes, congestion, traffic management, and networks. Based on technology, ITS can also be the base to develop more sustainable solutions.
