=====================================================<br />
(Supported by IEEE IES Technical Committee on Cloud and Wireless Systems for Industrial Applications)</p>
<p>On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is our great honor to invite all delegates, representatives, and participants from all around the world to take part in the 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), held 20-23 June 2021 in Kyoto, Japan. The ISIE annually gathers industry experts, researchers, and academics to share ideas and experiences surrounding frontier technologies, breakthroughs, innovative solutions, research results, and initiatives related to industrial electronics and their applications.</p>
<p>In case the author cannot come to Kyoto due to this pandemic, we will offer an option for remote (online) presentations.</p>
<p>Further information will be updated on this website at a later date.</p>
<p>The main theme of ISIE2021 is SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Especially “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, and “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”.</p>
<p>Moreover, the year “2021” is the 70th anniversary of IES. ISIE2021 will have “the commemorative event of 70th anniversary of IES”. Please enjoy and contribute to the 70th-anniversary events in ISIE2021!</p>
<p>Scope of the Session:<br />
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!<br />
ssion is to provide a forum for sci<br />
entists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-progress on all aspects of intelligent edge learning for industrial IoT.</p>
<p>Topics of interest:<br />
o Edge, fog, and mobile edge computing for Industrial IoT<br />
o Machine learning and computational intelligence for handling big data in Industrial applications<br />
o Information-centric networking and software-defined network for edge intelligence<br />
o Intelligent edge-based mobile computing and analysis<br />
o Multimedia QoS, and traffic management in industrial networks<br />
o Real-time communication interfaces and protocols<br />
o Intelligent infrastructures at the edge<br />
o Hardware testbed or field trial for AI-driven intelligent edge computing for industrial applications<br />
o Security and related considerations in intelligent edge computing<br />
o Intelligent routing and load balancing for edge computing<br />
o Multiple access technologies for edge computing<br />
o Network protocols for distributed machine learning</p>

<p><strong><em>CALL FOR PAPERS</em></strong></p>
<p>MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 18, 2021</p>
<p>Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis. Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication. Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely. These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities. But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered. Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently. In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses. As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported. How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing. How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users? For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!</p>
<p>COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.</p>
<p><strong><em>SUBMISSION</em></strong><br />
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 &amp; C1J2 program. All submissions must adhere to IEEE Publishing Policies, and will be vetted through the IEEE CrossCheck portal.</p>

<p>Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation. The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems. This represents a great challenge in network and/or systems design.</p>
<p>This Workshop focuses on applying AI technologies to deal with the networks and/or systems, particularly the machine learning techniques that are based on empirical or simulated data. Topics that may apply data driven intelligence to manage the complexity of a smart networks and/or systems include, but not limited to:</p>
<p>Data driven intelligence supported approaches and technologies<br />
Data driven intelligence supported applications and systems<br />
Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) support<br />
Resource allocation and transmission scheduling<br />
Medium access control design<br />
Data centers and cloud systems<br />
Radio access technology selection<br />
Spectrum sharing in intra- and inter-tier HetNets<br />
Traffic load estimation and resource reservation<br />
User mobility prediction and handover support<br />
Network fault detection and self-healing<br />

<p>JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON</p>
<p>Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19</p>
<p>PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021</p>
<p>Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:</p>
<p>● Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks</p>
<p>● AI/ML applied to epidemic data</p>
<p>● Approaches for resource constrained testing</p>
<p>● Adaptive interventions</p>
<p>● Contact tracing</p>
<p>● Mobile sensing for health monitoring</p>
<p>● Privacy in E-health</p>
<p>● Technologies to mitigate misinformation around epidemics</p>
<p>● Other communications and networking approaches relevant for combatting COVID-19</p>

<h1 id="scope">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

numerous challenges to be addressed, such as scalable and pervasive<br />
connectivity, sustainable networking, and new application paradigms<br />
for online activities.</p>
<p>The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages<br />
stimulating exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be<br />
a forum for discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network<br />
access protocols, network management and control, services and<br />
applications. Speculative and potentially transformative ideas are<br />
particularly encouraged, as are studies reporting measurements from<br />
real-life networks and testbeds. Papers are solicited on any topic in<br />
networking, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>Networking for online education and entertainment<br />
Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs<br />

<td>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions. New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity. To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR. New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors. Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas. Keywords</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>On the other hand, stochastic networks have emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm for addressing operational questions of matching demand and supply in modern platforms and marketplaces. Examples include ride-sharing platforms, labor platforms, energy markets, etc. A key value proposition of these platforms is the ability to learn from the tremendous amount of transactional data being generated to predict and mitigate supply-demand imbalances, and to recommend and make higher value matches than would otherwise be possible without centralized recommendations and/or matchmaking. Realizing this value proposition requires network control mechanisms that seamlessly assimilate information from data while being robust to strategic concerns.</td>

<p>Dear Colleagues,<br />
As one of the Guest Editors, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in the Special Issue on “Innovating the Network for Data-Intensive Science (INDIS 2020)” to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586). Manuscript submission deadline is March 31, 2021. For submission details, please see below or refer to our website: <a href="https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/cfp-journal/.">https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/cfp-journal/.</a></p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Sarah Neuwirth<br />
on behalf of the INDIS 2020 Guest Editors</p>
<p>================================<br />
Scope, Aims, and Topics<br />
================================<br />
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.</p>
<p>Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.</p>
<p>The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.</p>
<p>For this special issue to be published in Cluster Computing: The Journal of Networks, Software Tools and Applications (https://www.springer.com/journal/10586) related to the INDIS workshop, we encourage research papers that address one or more of the following networking research challenges; and developments that are essential in the information systems infrastructure for the scientific discovery process. Participants to the workshop are invited to submit extended versions of their accepted papers. We also welcome new paper submissions on related topics.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />
- Data-intensive distributed application architectures<br />
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in service of data science applications<br />
- High-performance data transfer applications and techniques<br />
- Science DMZs and other campus network architecture constructs<br />
- Requirements and issues for network quality of service (QoS) or experience (QoE)<br />
- Multi-domain networking, including hybrid clouds, multi-domain authorization, data sharing, and data privacy<br />
- Network monitoring and traffic analytics, autonomous network control<br />
- Network management: diagnostics, troubleshooting, fault management, performance monitoring, configuration management, and scheduling<br />
- High-performance network protocols and network architectures<br />
- Securing high-speed networks<br />
- Cross-layer network architectures and concepts</p>
<p>================================<br />
Submission Guidelines<br />
================================<br />

(Supported by IEEE IES Technical Committee on Cloud and Wireless Systems for Industrial Applications)</p>
<p>On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is our great honor to invite all delegates, representatives, and participants from all around the world to take part in the 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), held 20-23 June 2021 in Kyoto, Japan. The ISIE annually gathers industry experts, researchers, and academics to share ideas and experiences surrounding frontier technologies, breakthroughs, innovative solutions, research results, and initiatives related to industrial electronics and their applications.</p>
<p>In case the author cannot come to Kyoto due to this pandemic, we will offer an option for remote (online) presentations.</p>
<p>Further information will be updated on this website at a later date.</p>
<p>The main theme of ISIE2021 is SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Especially “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, and “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”.</p>
<p>Moreover, the year “2021” is the 70th anniversary of IES. ISIE2021 will have “the commemorative event of 70th anniversary of IES”. Please enjoy and contribute to the 70th-anniversary events in ISIE2021!</p>
<p>Scope of the Session:<br />
The intelligent edge computing paradigm for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is taking its shape where we envision it as an edge computing system that realizes the computing, communication, and caching resources using data analytic platform and harvesting the potential bene?ts of arti?cial intelligence to improve the system utility. There will be new opportunities for supporting real-time manufacturing and intelligent smart factory. However, many fundamental questions arise at the same time. For example, due to the computing and wireless network resource constraints, how and where to process the IoT data generated from massive distributed IoT devices are significant issues. Therefore, edge computing that is being actively investigated by many researchers in several technologies is yet to be applied to intelligent edge learning to support IIoT. Moreover, the selection of a learning algorithm will become a significant factor to be considered. The goal of the special se!<br />
ssion is to provide a forum for sci<br />
entists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-progress on all aspects of intelligent edge learning for industrial IoT.</p>

<p>Special Issue on “Smart Cyberphysical Systems and Cloud–Edge Engineering”<br />
Information - an Open Access Journal by MDPI<br />
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Cyberphysical_Cloud_Engineering)</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>At present, computers, smart sensors and devices are pervasive, and<br />
computational processes are increasingly becoming transparent to<br />
humans, making up the very fabric of contemporary societies. In this<br />
context, the cyberphysical system (CPS) paradigm is thriving. CPS<br />
refers to the integration of computation with physical processes. A<br />
CPS uses sensors and actuators to link the computational systems to<br />
the physical world. Through the instrumentation of the physical world,<br />
it is possible to monitor several variables and transfer data to<br />
cyberspace, where applications and services use such data to make<br />
decisions that affect and control physical processes, in a feedback<br />
loop. The ultimate goal of this integration is to improve processes,<br />
making them more effective and optimized, increasing productivity for<br />
companies and quality of life for citizens.</p>
<p>The recent advancement of computational intelligence techniques has<br />
leveraged the new generation of CPS, which is known as smart<br />
cyberphysical systems (sCPS). sCPS are distributed and<br />
software-intensive systems that, from heterogeneous data sources, both<br />
physical and virtual, and from their processing using computational<br />
intelligence paradigms, are able to efficiently and autonomously<br />
manage real-world processes. Such systems have the potential to<br />
optimize and support a wide range of application domains.</p>
<p>The growing scale, in terms of devices and data, of modern sCPS and<br />
the need to perform complex processing and provide fast responses<br />
makes cloud–edge platforms natural candidates for integrating such<br />
systems. By applying the model and principles of cloud computing to<br />
sCPS, any virtual or physical device, including sensors and actuators,<br />
is available as a service and can quickly and autonomously be<br />
provisioned for usage to meet the user and application demands. By<br />
leveraging the edge computing paradigm, time constraints of CPS can be<br />
dealt with.</p>
<p>In this context, this Special Issue intends to explore the multiple<br />
aspects of sCPS and the role of cloud–edge computing as an integrating<br />
and enabling platform for this paradigm. Potential topics of interest<br />
include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Cloud/edge/cloud–edge computing and services for cyberphysical systems;<br />
Resource management in cloud–edge-based sCPS;<br />
sCPS as a service;<br />
Design, implementation, and operation of cloud/edge/cloud–edge<br />
platforms for sCPS;<br />
Practical design issues in building cloud–edge-based sCPS;<br />
Managing big data for sCPS;<br />
Programming models, benchmarks, and tools for cloud-based sCPS;<br />
Virtualization models for sCPS;<br />
Architectures and frameworks for sCPS;<br />
Interoperability issues in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;<br />
Solutions for reliability and resilience in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS;<br />
Self-adaptation, self-healing, and self-configuration in sCPS;<br />
Real-time data analytics and data stream processing for sCPS;<br />
Context-aware event processing for sCPS;<br />
Internet of Things and real-time services for sCPS;<br />
Security challenges in cloud/edge/cloud–edge-based sCPS.</p>

<p>Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.</p>
<p>IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.</p>
<p>The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.</p>

<p>Empowering Sustainable Energy Infrastructures via AI-assisted Wireless Communications<br />
IEEE Wireless Communications<br />
<a href="https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy">https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy</a></p>
<p>Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.</p>
<p>Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.</p>
<p>This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:</p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

</li>
<li>WiSec conference: June 28 to July 1, 2021</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="full-and-short-papers">Full and short papers</h1>
<p>Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2021 can be up to 10 pages in the<br />
ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked<br />
appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the<br />
submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including<br />
bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more<br />
succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for<br />
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available<br />
on the WiSec 2021 website at <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.">https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.</a></p>
<p>For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge<br />
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing<br />
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an<br />
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or<br />
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a<br />
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps<br />
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such<br />
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by<br />
the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.<br />
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same<br />
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing<br />
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the<br />
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and<br />
included in the proceedings.</p>
<h1 id="posters-and-demos">Posters and demos</h1>
<p>WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to<br />
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.</p>
<h1 id="replicability-label">Replicability label</h1>
<p>WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.<br />
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to<br />
minimize the overhead of applying for this label.<br />
The process of reviewing the work for replicability will be largely<br />
similar to the previous years.</p>
<h1 id="double-submissions">Double submissions</h1>
<p>It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,<br />
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently<br />
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions<br />
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals<br />
involved.</p>
<h1 id="workshops-and-tutorial">Workshops and Tutorial</h1>
<p>ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorial co-organized with the main<br />
conference. Details will be made available on the website.</p>

<h1 id="important-dates-5">Important dates</h1>
<ul>
<li>Paper submission deadline: March 18, 2021 (23:59 AoE)<br />
</li>
<li>Author notification: April 29, 2021<br />
</li>
<li>Camera-ready deadline: May 21, 2021 (23:59 AoE)<br />
</li>
<li>WiSec conference: June 28 to July 1, 2021</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="full-and-short-papers-1">Full and short papers</h1>
<p>Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2021 can be up to 10 pages in the<br />
ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked<br />
appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the<br />
submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including<br />
bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more<br />
succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for<br />
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available<br />
on the WiSec 2021 website at <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.">https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.</a></p>
<p>For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge<br />
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing<br />
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an<br />
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or<br />
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a<br />
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps<br />
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such<br />
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by<br />
the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.<br />
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same<br />
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing<br />
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the<br />
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and<br />
included in the proceedings.</p>
<h1 id="posters-and-demos-1">Posters and demos</h1>
<p>WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to<br />
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.</p>
<h1 id="replicability-label-1">Replicability label</h1>
<p>WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.<br />
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to<br />
minimize the overhead of applying for this label. The process of<br />
reviewing the work for replicability will be largely similar to the<br />
previous years.</p>
<h1 id="double-submissions-1">Double submissions</h1>
<p>It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,<br />
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently<br />
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions<br />
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals<br />
involved.</p>
<h1 id="workshops-and-tutorial-1">Workshops and Tutorial</h1>
<p>ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorial co-organized with the main<br />
conference. Details will be made available on the website.</p>

<p><strong><em>Call for Papers</em></strong></p>
<p>The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications. We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification</p></li>
<li><p>Use of data analytics, data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning in network measurement and analysis</p></li>
