<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 is revolutionising our daily habits and<br />
individual/social behaviour, with many physical activities being “migrated”<br />
to the online world. On the other hand, we are relying more and more on<br />
online services to track and fight the diffusion of the new virus.<br />
While these phenomena are a consequence of an emergency situation,<br />
it is very likely that such changes will have a significant long-term impact.</p>
<p>Online and Mobile Social Networks are a particularly intriguing environment<br />
in this framework. The OSNEM usage has changed dramatically since the emergence<br />
of the pandemic. Moreover, OSNEM can be used to shed light, through big data analysis,<br />
on novel individual and social behaviours of people. Last but not least, OSNEM are<br />
increasingly used to track the pandemic, via Online and Mobile Social Platforms<br />
helping to track physical contacts between people. As the role of OSNEM is becoming<br />
ever more important, challenges and threats to privacy, trust in information,<br />
fake news, malicious behaviour are posing even more serious threats.</p>
<p>This special issue seeks high-quality scientific articles (both theoretical and<br />
experimental) on the use of OSNEM at the time of COVID-19, to either characterise<br />
the human behaviour via large-scale OSNEM data analysis, or using OSNEM to<br />
fight the pandemic. Papers describing the process used to collect and use<br />
large-scale datasets from OSNEM platforms are welcome, provided datasets are<br />
made available to the research community.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:<br />
- Characterisation of OSNEM usage at the time of COVID-19 via OSNEM big data analysis<br />
- Models of individual and social behaviour through OSNEM big data during the pandemic<br />
- Characterisation of social network structures during pandemic via OSNEM large-scale data<br />
- Opinion formation, information diffusion and polarization related to COVID-19<br />
- Tracking of COVID-19 diffusion through Online Social Networks analysis<br />
- Mobile Social Networking applications and services to fight the COVID-19 diffusion<br />
- COVID-19 e-health services based on OSNEM<br />
- Privacy issues in the use of Online and Mobile Social Networks to fight COVID-19<br />
- Tools to detect and counteract disinformation and malicious behaviours<br />
related the COVID-19 phenomena<br />
- Tools to assess and verify trustworthiness of COVID-19 related information and accounts<br />
- OSNEM data-driven approaches to study COVID-19 related phenomena<br />
- Multidisciplinary applications of OSNEM (economics, medicine, society, politics,<br />
homeland security, etc.) to fight COVID-19<br />
- COVID-19 publicly available OSNEM datasets: collection, usage and sharing</p>
<p>Online Social Networks and Media is a multidisciplinary journal for the wide community<br />
of computer and network scientists working on developing OSNEM platforms and services<br />
and using OSNEM as a big data source to mine, learn and model the (online) human behaviour.<br />
Manuscripts only based on questionnaires, even focused on the reported use of social media,<br />
are outside the scope of the journal. On the other hand, the journal welcomes papers which<br />
present analyses based on big data mined from social networks/media.</p>

<td>CALL FOR PAPERS Dealing with data from different modalities, is the common case in today’s systems. With the continuous development in network technologies, acquisition systems, and computational power, creating and sharing multimedia data is becoming easier for all people around the world. On Facebook, for example, around 500000 comments are posted and around 135000 images are uploaded every second. Storing, searching in, analyzing, and utilizing Multimedia data is highly challenging. That is why the International Conference on Multimedia Computing, Networking and Applications (MCNA) gives the opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their efforts in addressing the challenges of dealing with Multimedia data. The main topics include but are not limited to: Intelligent Image / Video Analytics Digital Image and Video Processing Image Rendering and Quality Imaging Sensors and Acquisition Systems Content Based Image/Video Retrieval Vision for Graphics Human Behavior Understanding Deep Artificial Intelligence Motion and Tracking Algorithms and Applications Watermarking Methods and Protection Image Data Structures and Databases Color Reproduction Image Compression, Coding, and Encryption Statistical and Structural Pattern Recognition Performance Analysis and Evaluation Novel Image Processing Applications Machine Learning Technologies for Vision Multimedia in Bioinformatics Virtual Reality and Simulations Augmented Reality Image Processing Computational and Architectural Aspects of Human Vision Innovative Multimedia Systems or Devices Internet / Mobile Multimedia Sharing Intelligent e-Health based on Multimedia Analysis Games and Gamification Optimization Methods in Multimedia systems Vision and Languages Full Paper Important Dates Full paper submission: August 1st, 2020 Full paper acceptance notification: August 30th, 2020 Full paper camera-ready submission: September 13th, 2020 Submission Site <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mcna2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mcna2020</a></td>

<td>The theme of this year’s conference is “Embarking on a new era of learning with transformative technologies.”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The conference theme challenges us to look anew at how the potential of current and emerging technologies can and/or should be harnessed for education and learning in our ever-changing world. Over the last several decades, digital technologies have revolutionized the way we work, play and learn—arguably changing our lives for the better overall—but they have not come without their problems and challenges (e.g., environmental degradation, social inequity arising from the “digital divide,” ethical and moral dilemmas brought about by artificial intelligence). Over the next ten years (2020–2029), technologies such as AI, robotics, brain–computer interfaces, and extended or cross-reality (XR) that augment human sensory abilities, cognition and performance will continue to evolve and have a transformative impact. How can we ensure this transformation is positive, both for and through learning? As these technologies increasingly blur the boundaries between human and machine, and between physical and virtual, what can we do so the technology works toward our advantage, for the betterment of all of society and of our planet? Participants of TALE 2020 are encouraged to engage with these and other questions from creative, multidimensional and interdisciplinary perspectives as we stand on the precipice of this new era of learning with transformative technologies.</td>

<p>JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON</p>
<p>THZ WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br />
PUBLICATION DATE: April 2021</p>
<p>Terahertz wireless communications in the frequency band from 100GHz to 10THz is a rapidly growing and is considered as very feasible new area which can enable an order of 0.1 Tbps personal communications over vast available channels as well as chip-to-chip, massive IoT connections, and many other applications. Especially, the recent significant progress on RF technologies anticipates the THz wireless systems realizable in the near future and is discussed in the academy and the industry for possible new frequency band in beyond 5G cellular systems. Recent works on THz wireless communications have been focused on the propagation studies, channel capacity of MIMO systems, general consideration of system characteristics, RF transceiver design.</p>
<p>Despite the enormous studies in THz wireless communications in the last decade, the state-of-art is far from meeting the challenges of the near-future communication systems in terms of communication system design and usage model considering the characteristics of THz band. In particular, the possible coverage of a cell using THz band needs to be clearly studied based on the current and the near coming RF technologies.</p>
<p>This special issue on Terahertz Communications seeks original research articles as well as expository and survey papers, addressing the challenges of future THz wireless communications systems. Example topics of interest:</p>
<p>ü Information theoretic foundation of THz wireless communications</p>
<p>ü RF technologies for personal communications</p>
<p>ü Beamforming and MIMO</p>
<p>ü Machine learning aided THz communications</p>
<p>ü Resource allocation and multiple-access schemes for THz communications</p>
<p>ü Protocol design for THz networking</p>
<p>ü Demonstrations of wireless links beyond 100 GHz band</p>
<p>ü Beam propagation and channel model</p>
<p>ü Channel estimation</p>
<p>ü Waveform design for THz wireless communications</p>
<p>ü Backhaul and Fronthaul of THz systems</p>
<p>ü Application scenarios of THz wireless communications</p>

<p>Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. Please visit the submission link to send your manuscript:<br />
<a href="http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2020">http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2020</a><br />
(The submission site will open soon)</p>
<p>Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere and must be<br />
cleared for publication in the NCA Proceedings, which will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. The manuscript<br />
must be written in English, and must not exceed 8 pages for NCA papers or 4 pages for workshop papers. Following last year’s<br />
success, NCA also invites manuscripts presenting Work-in-Progress (WiP), which must not exceed 3 pages. More details about<br />
the WiP track can be found in the NCA website. All submissions must be in PDF format.</p>
<p>Manuscript page limit:</p>
<p>Regular Papers: 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.<br />
Short Papers: 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.<br />
WiP Papers: 3 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.</p>
<p>Purchasing extra pages:</p>
<p>Regular Papers: Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at $100 (US dollars) per extra page.<br />
Short Papers: Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at $100 (US dollars).</p>
<p>Authors can decide to submit papers longer than 8/4 pages (up to 10 and 5, depending on the category) before the reviewing<br />
process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore, longer<br />
papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions, in case of acceptance. This is to respect the work made by<br />
reviewers and other authors who decided to stay in the limits.</p>
<p><em>ACCEPTED PAPERS AND PUBLICATION POLICIES</em></p>
<p>Every paper accepted at NCA must have attached to it at least one registration at the full (member or non-member) rate. Thus,<br />
for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration<br />
rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation for up to<br />
two (2) papers.</p>
<p>No-show papers are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper at the technical meeting.<br />
This year, due to COVID-19, NCA will be a fully virtual conference, with no travel involved. All presentations will be given<br />
via pre-recorded videos, followed by synchronized online discussions during the conference period. For an accepted paper to not<br />
be considered as “no-show”, at least one of its authors will have to prepare a video presentation and provide it to the organizers<br />
who will make it available to the participants of the conference. Moreover, at least one author of the accepted paper will have<br />
to participate to the online discussions that are relevant to their paper. Instructions for these will be provided at the NCA<br />
website.</p>
<p>Presentations by proxies are not allowed, unless explicitly approved <em>before</em> the conference by the technical co-chairs. No-show<br />
papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings must be identified as “No-Show” in the files submitted to IEEE<br />
for further publication (IEEE Xplore). No-shows will not be available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE will<br />
maintain an archive of no-shows.</p>
<p>The IEEE strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program.</p>
<p>If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE policy dictates that the<br />
request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE policy also states that in this case,<br />
the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the<br />
expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in<br />
this regard.</p>
<p><em>BEST PAPER AWARDS</em></p>
<p>The IEEE NCA 2020 Program Committee will select Best Paper and Best Student Paper. The first author of the Best Student Paper must<br />
be a PhD student.</p>

<p>G E N E R A L I N F O R M A T I O N</p>
<p>Nanotechnology continues to revolutionize a wide variety of fields by paving the way toward sub-µm scale devices (i.e., in the order of a few hundred nanometers). Controlling materials on such a scale is expected to give rise to integrated nanodevices with simple sensing, actuation, data processing and storage, and communication capabilities, opening the horizon to a variety of ground-breaking applications. By equipping nanodevices with wireless communications capabilities, nanotechnology will facilitate the advance of multiple disruptive applications, such as in-body communication, software-defined metamaterials and metasurfaces, wireless robotic materials, and on-chip communication. Enabling the above applications will require a broad range of expertise, ranging from nanoscale hardware design, resource-constrained computing, and channel modelling to different layers of nanonetworks’ protocol development, as well as the expertise along the four detected promising application domains.</p>
<p>The First ACM International Workshop on Nanoscale Computing, Communication, and Applications (ACM NanoCoCoA 2020) will be held in conjunction with the The 18th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2020) on November 16, 2020. The twofold mission of this workshop is to increase the visibility of nanoscale computing, communication, networking, and supported applications, as well as to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines that can foster and develop this fast developing field.</p>

<p>In today’s scenario, each individual faces substantial complications relating to transportation systems such as congestion, vehicle parking difficulties, pollution caused by an increased level of carbon dioxide emission, longer traveling times, road accidents, etc. These consequences are due to the rising number of vehicular systems and rapid urbanization processes. This leads to the development of modern technologies such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANET), VANET cloud (VC), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Among all these techniques, IoV remains the most prominent and emerging one. IoV is a series of interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other through a common public network. It is a highly integrated application of two major domains IoT and ITS. The communication across the IoV network includes three different types: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P).</p>
<p>Smart vehicles with progressive communication abilities do not only communicate with broadcast and navigation satellites but also with various smart devices such as roadside units, smart vehicles, and passenger smartphones. Since IoV has widespread interconnected networks with numerous users, there is an increased risk of security and privacy measures. These security and privacy concerns may lead to serious consequences if they are not addressed and dealt with in an appropriate manner.

<p>Special Issue Information</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Information hiding techniques and network covert channels are becoming<br />
fundamental to assess the security characteristics of the Internet. On<br />
the one hand, they can be used as offensive tools to empower malware,<br />
for instance, to bypass security policies of infected nodes, to secretly<br />
exfiltrate data towards remote command and control facilities, or to<br />
orchestrate a botnet or launch an attack without being detected by<br />
de-facto standard security tools. On the other hand, information hiding<br />
and network covert channels can be used to enforce copyright of digital<br />
artifacts via watermarking, trace network flows for traffic engineering<br />
purposes, and implement privacy enhancing services. From this<br />
perspective, this Special Issue aims at collecting new work addressing<br />
different aspects of information hiding and network covert channels.</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit original work on (but not limited to) the<br />
following topics:</p>
<p>Model detection techniques and the mitigation of information<br />
hiding-capable threats;<br />
Colluding application attacks and exfiltration techniques;<br />
New mechanisms to orchestrate botnets and hide data exfiltration;<br />
Novel detection techniques for network covert channels, with an emphasis<br />
on scalability;<br />
Advanced network covert channels, for instance, those leveraging<br />
reversible steganographic methods;<br />
Information hiding for obfuscation, anti-forensics techniques, and<br />
covert data storage;<br />
Watermarking of network flows for traffic engineering and security;<br />
Privacy enhancing frameworks based on information hiding.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>With the digital revolution, edge analytics along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become important parts of our lives and are getting tremendous attention from industry, academia, governments, and from the smart connected living community as a whole. The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the true vision of the connected world into reality with a massive amount of data and numerous services. However, because of the massive connectivity of IoT-connected devices in providing numerous connected living services, computation becomes more intensive and storage burden increases at each edge device. To address these challenges, AI-powered edge computing provides powerful computation services and massive data acquisition at edge networks in an intelligent manner for autonomous decision-making, at a level that is impossible for individual human analysts. The edge-AI (edge analytics driven by AI) has the capability to self-learn from data, understand patterns, optimize, make predictions, and provide fresh insights to stakeholders of connected living for better decisions with improved Quality of Services (QoS). Even though researchers have been making advances in AI and edge data analytics individually, relatively less attention has been given to build a cost-effective edge-AI driven connected living ecosystem while considering many aspects of its algorithms, communications, offloading, caching, architectures, framework, and services. Even today, many technical challenges need to be addressed in this convergence of edge-AI driven connected living paradigm.</p>
<p>The aim of this special issue is to bring academic researchers and industry developers together for sharing the recent advances and future trends of AI-driven edge intelligence for connected living. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Explainable AI (XAI) and predictive edge analytics for infectious diseases such as COVID-19<br />
Edge AI-assisted COVID-19 and similar infectious disease detection or diagnosis systems<br />
AI-centric Mobile Edge Computing approach for Connected Living<br />
AI-enabled IoT-edge data analytics for Connected Living<br />
AI-enabled edge data fusion for Connected Living<br />
ML-driven edge approach to Connected Living<br />
AI/Deep Learning/Machine Learning based networked applications, techniques and testbeds for Connected Living<br />
AI-driven multi access edge computing approach for Connected Living<br />
New opportunities, challenges, case studies, and applications of Edge-AI for Connected Living<br />
Security, Privacy, and Trust of Edge-AI for Connected Living</p>

<p>As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.</p>
<p>These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.</p>
<p>IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (IEEE TNSM) is a premier journal for timely publication of archival research on the management of networks, systems, services and applications. Following the success of the last recent TNSM special issue on cybersecurity techniques for managing networked systems in 2020, this special issue will also focus on latest developments for security management of networks and services. We welcome submissions addressing the important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!</p>

<p><strong><em>Submissions due: October 31st, 2020</em></strong></p>
<p>We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.</p>
<p>Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.</p>
<p>Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.</p>
<p>This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI.

<p>=========================================================================</p>
<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers:</h2>
<p>The first issue of “Software: Practice and Experience”, published in<br />
1971, reported on applications that could be described in a few thousand<br />
lines of code; today, software systems are among the most complex<br />
entities produced by humans. This growth has spawned new development<br />
methodologies and exposed serious systemic weaknesses.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years, our most pressing problems have moved from the<br />
seven development issues that David Barron focused on in his inaugural<br />
editorial to issues brought about by the scope and ubiquity of our<br />
current applications: Software systems must now be resistant to attack<br />
by malicious agents, and must operate successfully with improper inputs.<br />
Cyber-physical systems must avoid entering states that would damage<br />
equipment or harm people. Applications built as a collection of<br />
cooperating processes must be able to deliver results in a timely<br />
manner, even when the number of simultaneous users fluctuates<br />
significantly. Whether or not these issues can be dealt with by current<br />
design methodology is an open question. Regardless of the answer,<br />
however, Barron’s vision for the journal as a venue for authors to<br />
present their work in a form that will be useful to others remains valid<br />
as we move into the next 50 years.</p>
<p>We invite high quality papers that discuss the development of new ideas,<br />
models, paradigms, and systems evolution appropriate to the challenges<br />
facing the field today. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br />
* Threat models for software systems<br />
* Performance improvement in distributed systems<br />
* Scalability of software<br />
* User interface design<br />
* Workflow management<br />
* Application Programming Models and Environments<br />
* Advances in systems software powering embedded devices to<br />
large-scale computing environments<br />
* Internet-driven Innovative Applications</p>

<h2 id="important-dates">IMPORTANT DATES</h2>
<p>Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-topics">SCOPE AND TOPICS</h2>
<p>During the last decade, 5G technology has been developed and successfully commercialized for mobile communication networks. 5G technology supports enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication, massive machine type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT), devices and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical devices with IMT-2020 standard aims.</p>
<p>Some key technologies, such as 5G numerology with new radio (NR) waveform in sub- or above 6 GHz (mmWave) bands and MIMO with beamforming, allow those heterogeneous devices or services to overcome their own challenging scenarios. Still, 5G access technology has further challenges, as it is now evolving with convergence technologies, such as autonomously driven vehicles, smart factories, satellite or UAS, public safety, etc. This 5G+ demands more bandwidth, connectivity, and reliability.</p>
<p>Wireless communications in the Terahertz (THz) frequency band and unlicensed bands such as private 5G are considered to provide ultra-high user data rates. Further, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been explored for spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. V2X communication using mmWave side-links is not under-standardized. 5G and 6G now consider interoperation of GEO or LEO satellites and UAS to control autonomous vehicles, including drones, and provide wide-area cells for public safety or content broadcast. This nationwide cell can improve reliability and service continuity. As 5G+ pursues more than low-latency end-to-end access delay (&lt;1 ms), mobile edge computing (MEC) has received attention in terms of supporting the requirements of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) to improve performance.</p>
<p>This Special Issue will present the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 5G access communication and its evolution. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit their original manuscripts.</p>

<p>Motivations<br />
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>
<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Graph-based representations to space and time phenomena;</p></li>
<li><p>Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Multiscale modelling;</p></li>
<li><p>Combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal query languages within GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal GIS interfaces;</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal indoor GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Location-based time GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal web and wireless GIS;</p></li>

<td>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</td>
