<p>COVID-19 Statement</p>
<p>ICIN 2021 is planned to be held in Paris on March 1-4th 2021. The organizing committee (OC) is closely monitoring the development of the COVID-19 situation that could impact paper submissions and in-person attendance. In case of travel restrictions, a partially or fully virtual conference could become necessary and video/remote presentations will be accepted. In addition, the OC is also investigating remote participation under all circumstances especially for accepted papers.</p>
<p>About ICIN</p>
<p>Since 1989, the ICIN conferences have been bringing together leading Internet and telecom experts from industry, academia and government from across the globe. ICIN is a single track conference that is both intimate and global, attracting 100+ delegates, from more than 20 countries. It focuses on leading edge investigations into Internet technologies, from basic networking and cloud services to novel architectures. ICIN uses a rigorous peer-review process and has become an established industry forum to discuss emerging trends in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It offers an agora for one-on-one discussions and cross-fertilization between participants and leading network visionaries, with the goal of promoting dialogue and ideation about the current and future trends in networking research and development. ICIN conferences are well known for their identification of research challenges and industry trends and their discussion on the impact of cutting-edge technologies on future intelligent and distributed networking, and related computing services. ICIN has an enviable track record of identifying key technologies and services – and analysing their impact on business models – before they become widely recognized in the industry and government communication sectors. The interdisciplinary approach and the cross-fertilization of ideas are the main ingredients that made ICIN a recognized event in the telecommunications, cloud networking and Internet communities.</p>
<p>ICIN 2021</p>
<p>For 2021 ICIN is focussing on the melding of network and computing services that is clearly demonstrated by the increasing softwarization of the network services in the core and the access networks, the rise of computing in the network and the growth of cognition in networking for management and control, as well as for value added services at the edge and in the data center. Several innovations are impacting the ongoing transformations toward the network of the future and the evolution of cloud services. More and more the network fabric itself emcompasses functionality usually associated with computing as increased intelligence and cognition are necessary to address emerging requirements of distributed services, automation and network reliability. At the same time, more and more, the cloud is extending to the edge adding a number of heterogeneous networked subsystems to the Internet with a variety of requirements that further highlight the need for novel architectures, e.g., IoT systems, augmented and virtual reality and service delivery platforms.</p>
<p>The result is the networking and computing systems becoming one, melding, as a distributed cloud/edge continuum with cognition and intelligence for emerging services. This “Computing and Networking as a Service” is the paradigm that will be central to the deployment of immersive services in many different sectors, such as e-health, self-driving cars, industrial networks, agriculture and cloud robotics. In this regard, there is a need for a variety of mechanisms enabling the new generation of service offerings at different levels (consumer, business, government, social, service provider ecosystem platforms).</p>
<p>In this scenario and considering the many challenges that the aforementioned paradigms and technologies will bring, the theme for ICIN 2021 is:</p>
<p>“Services everywhere: melding networking and computing in an intelligent cloud-edge continuum”</p>
<p>The conference will foster discussion about new ideas and novel approaches for future service concepts, service delivery and their enabling technologies and mechanisms in the emerging scenario of immersive intelligence and service level awareness. With this vision, the conference will look beyond the current state of the art and promote the advances of Computing as a Service technologies for different application service delivery platforms.</p>
<p>Interested authors are invited to submit papers presenting novel technical research, research related to business impact or mechanisms of new technologies, as well as broader position and visionary papers. Contributions that discuss lessons learnt and best practices, describe practical deployment and implementation experiences as well as demonstrating innovative use-cases are also and especially encouraged.</p>

Scope and Topics of Interest</p>
<p>There have been unprecedented advances in developing technologies to<br />
enable the next generation networks, which will seamlessly integrate the<br />
computing equipment with networking to provide the computing-harvesting<br />
next generation services. Thanks to the huge enhancement of computing<br />

<td>Automated vehicles are expected to have a significant impact in the transport sector in the next decades, improving road safety and traffic efficiency, as well as reducing energy consumption and improving user comfort. Automated vehicles make use of a set of onboard sensors installed in the vehicle (e.g. camera, radar and lidar) that are responsible for perceiving the surrounding environment, and a set of actuators that control its longitudinal and lateral movements. One of the development objectives is to automatically perform driving tasks with less or even without driver intervention. Several studies have already shown that the sensors used in the perception process have limitations that might degrade the performance of automated vehicles. For example, in adverse weather conditions (such as rain, snow and fog), the cameras will not be able to adequately capture the environment, and in situations where the sensor’s field of vision is blocked (by other vehicles or buildings) none of the current sensors can detect beyond the position of the obstacle. To overcome these limitations and improve the perception capabilities of the vehicles, cooperative perception enables the wireless exchange of sensor information between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure nodes. Cooperative perception, also known as cooperative sensing or collective perception, enables vehicles and infrastructure nodes to detect objects (e.g. non-connected vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles) beyond their local sensing capabilities. Cooperative perception can be key for extended and timely detection of the surrounding environment and can also enable cooperative applications by compensating low penetration rates of connected road users, thus facilitating the future deployment of automated vehicles.</td>

<td>About the Workshop: Cooperative vehicular networking is widely acknowledged as a key enabler of the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), known as Cooperative-ITS. The range of application of C-ITS is very large, including driving assistance - cooperative awareness, cooperative intersection management, cooperative platoon control, etc. Thanks to V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) communication technology, all ITS actors (vehicles, infrastructure and other road users) can cooperatively exchange real-time information, leading to increasing levels of safety and efficiency. The V2X technology combines different communication technologies, from short and medium-range ad-hoc direct communication to 3G/4G (future 5G) cellular network communication to realize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-person (V2P) network connections. Developing C-ITS applications has to cope with many challenges, related to control theory and signal processing as well as wireless communication. C-ITS applications impose different requirements in terms of latency, throughput, reliability on the network and safety of the V2X environment.</td>

<p>As the backbone of communications amongst objects, humans, companies, and administrations, the Internet has become a great integration platform capable of efficiently interconnecting billions of entities, from RFID chips to data centers. This platform provides access to multiple hardware and virtualized resources (servers, networking, storage, applications, connected objects) coming from cloud computing and internet-of-things infrastructures. From these resources that may be hosted and distributed amongst different providers and tenants, the building and operation of complex and value-added networked systems is enabled.</p>
<p>These networked systems are, however, subject to a large variety of security attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, web-injection and malicious software attacks, orchestrated in a more or less stealthy manner through the Internet. While they are gaining in sophistication and coordination (i.e. advanced persistent threats), these attacks may affect the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation of resources. The accessibility, distribution, and increased complexity of networked systems make them particularly vulnerable targets. In that context, cybersecurity techniques offer new perspectives for protecting these networked systems, through the elaboration of intelligent and efficient management methods for detecting, analyzing and mitigating such attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Paper - Special Session “Computational Intelligence for Web Economy” </strong></p>
<p>=============================================================================</p>
<p>12th International Conference on Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR 2020) December 15-18, 2020, online</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mirlabs.net/socpar20/">http://www.mirlabs.net/socpar20/</a></p>
<p>Web Economy refers to an economy that is based on digital computing technologies. It is also referred to as the Internet Economy, New Economy, or Digital Economy. It results from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, intelligent devices (IoT), data, and processes. The amount of available data grows exponentially and traditional data analysis techniques are unsuitable to extract useful information from such vast amounts of data; thus, intelligent data analysis methods combining human expertise and computational models for accurate and in-depth data analysis are necessary. Computational intelligence (CI) methods such as fuzzy models, artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and probabilistic methods have recently emerged as promising tools for the development and application of intelligent systems for Web Economy. CI-based systems can learn from data and evolve according to changes in the environments by taking into account the uncertainty characterizing health data and processes. The use of CI for Web Economy can improve the management of economic and behavioral data by introducing intelligent solutions for prediction, network analysis, anomaly detection, opinion mining, as well for analysis of administrative processes.</p>
<p>This Special Session will publish original research, overviews, and applications of CI methods for Web Economy. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Fuzzy logic and fuzzy models for Web Economy</p>
<p>Evolutionary computing for Web Economy</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks for Web Economy</p>

<p>CALL FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS</p>
<p>===========================</p>
<p>Recent advances in the field of telecommunications and electronics have led to the proliferation of autonomous robots in numerous novel application fields, from emergency situations to military applications, from infrastructure inspection to ambient monitoring services, where the utilization of multiple robots is essential in order to accomplish the desired task. Recent works have demonstrated the challenges of coordinating multiple robots in order to deploy robot networks with self-configuration and self-healing capabilities to guarantee service continuity, also in case of failures.</p>
<p>Starting from the unique requirements of a multi robot system, Swarm Robotics is a complex approach that requires an understanding of how to define distributed systems to define self-organization behaviors. Swarm Robotics studies how to make robots collaborate and collectively solve a task where every robot contributes to the general task sharing the same higher-level objectives. To this end, communication wireless networks must be specifically designed in order to support the cooperation and collaboration inside the swarm.</p>
<p>This workshop invites original research articles and review articles that focus on communication networking problems in swarm robotics.</p>

<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) Conference 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pam2021.b-tu.de">https://www.pam2021.b-tu.de</a></p>
<p>The Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) conference brings together<br />
researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area<br />
of network measurement and analysis. PAM is inclusive of all areas of<br />
network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and<br />
real-world data. Indeed, measurement technology is needed at all layers<br />
of the network stack, ranging from power profiling of hardware<br />
components to virtualization in data centers to application profiling<br />
and even user experience. Work with operational impact or relevance to<br />
the broader network research community is especially welcome, as is<br />
early and promising measurement technique. Original contributions that<br />
advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas are invited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications (e.g., web, streaming, games)<br />
</li>
<li>Data centers and cloud computing<br />
</li>
<li>Energy<br />
</li>
<li>IoT (e.g., smart home, SCADA, ICS, embedded systems)<br />
</li>
<li>Measurement tools and software<br />
</li>
<li>Network security and privacy<br />
</li>
<li>Overlays (e.g., P2P, CDNs)<br />
</li>
<li>Physical Layer<br />
</li>
<li>Routing<br />
</li>
<li>Social networks<br />
</li>
<li>Topology<br />
</li>
<li>Transport/congestion control<br />
</li>
<li>User behavior and experience, QoE<br />
</li>
<li>Virtualization (e.g., SDN, NFV)<br />
</li>
<li>Visualization<br />
</li>
<li>Wireless and mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>Although PAM traditionally attracts early stage contributions, works<br />
that are a reappraisal or independent validation of previous results, or<br />
which enhance the reproducibility of network measurement research, for<br />
instance by publishing new datasets on an existing topic, are explicitly<br />
included in PAM’s scope. Thus, in addition to full research papers as<br />
described above, PAM also invites submission in the following two<br />
categories:</p>
<p>PAM 2021 will be held virtually.</p>
<p><em>Important Dates</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Paper Registration</em> October 16th, 2020 | 23:59 EDT<br />

</ul>
<p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>
<p>Authors should only submit original work that has not been published<br />
before and is not under submission to any other venue. All submissions<br />
must satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow Springer LNCS format (see<br />
<a href="https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)</a>)<br />
</li>
<li>Up to 12 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and<br />
references)<br />
</li>
<li>Note that reviewers are not required to read appendices.<br />
Everything needed to evaluate the paper should appear in the first 12 pages.<br />
</li>
<li>Anonymization: Reviewing will be double-blind:<br />
</li>
<li>Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission.<br />
</li>
<li>Refer to your prior work in the third person.<br />
</li>
<li>Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would give you away.<br />
</li>
<li>If you have any concerns about how to anonymize your paper while<br />
maintaining its integrity, contact the PC chairs.<br />
</li>
<li>Submit via HotCRP: <a href="https://hotcrp.cs.umd.edu/pam2021/">https://hotcrp.cs.umd.edu/pam2021/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethical Considerations</em></p>
<p>Following the standard set by the Internet Measurement Conference (from<br />
which we base this section), papers describing experiments with users or<br />
sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network<br />
information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and<br />
subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure<br />
storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are<br />
placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential,<br />
beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society<br />
while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation. When<br />
appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection (in the main<br />
paper, not in the Appendix) describing these issues. Authors may want to<br />
consult the Menlo Report<br />
(http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/)<br />
for further information on ethical principles and the Allman/Paxson IMC<br />
2007 paper (https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf)<br />
for guidance on ethical data sharing. Note that submitting research for<br />
approval by each author’s institutional ethics review body is necessary,<br />
but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the<br />
ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical<br />
soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical<br />
soundness. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact<br />
the program committee co-chairs.</p>
<p><em>Awards</em></p>
<p>There will be two awards for papers of exceptional merit. The <strong>Best<br />
Paper Award</strong> will recognize the paper that is deemed by the committee<br />
to have the highest merit of all the submissions. The <em>Best Dataset<br />
Award</em> will be given to the best paper that makes datasets and<br />
corresponding code available to the public by the time the camera-ready<br />
is submitted. These artifacts must be sufficiently documented such that<br />
any researcher can use them to repeat the results described in the<br />
paper, and they must be placed in a sufficiently long-lived archival<br />
repository (e.g., Github, Bitbucket, or CRAWDAD).</p>

<p>Paper Submission<br />
Paper submission must be in English. All papers will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity. All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.<br />
Each submitted paper should include an abstract up to 200 words and be no longer than 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) in LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format. We encourage authors to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable. All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF only.<br />
The submitted papers must not be previously published anywhere and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process. If the paper was accepted, at least one author will complete the regular registration and attend the conference to present the paper. For no-show authors, their papers will not be included in the proceedings. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Double-Blind Review<br />
DASFAA 2021 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, i.e., the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:<br />
- Author’s names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.<br />
- Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.<br />
- Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.<br />
- Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the author’s names in the paper’s associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. Submissions must have all details identifying the author(s) removed from the original manuscript (including the supplementary files, if any), and the author(s) should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations.<br />
It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection. Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has published elsewhere is strongly discouraged in DASFAA 2021. Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports (e.g., arXiv or similar) cannot be considered for DASFAA 2021.</p>

<p>Contact Tracing refers to the process of tracking persons who may have come<br />
into spatial contact with an infected person, and subsequently collecting<br />
further information about these contacts. The feature-rich interaction,<br />
processing and localization/communication modalities of smartphone devices,<br />
have brought these to battle on the technological forefront and have curbed<br />
the fast spread of pandemics, like COVID-19, introducing the notion of<br />
“digital vaccines” to custodians aiming at fast prevention rather than<br />
slow intervention.</p>
<p>The community has to this date proposed a wide range of approaches, ranging<br />
from: opportunistic to participatory approaches, privacy-sensitive to<br />
no-privacy approaches, handheld-based (distributed) to cloud-based<br />
(centralized) approaches, proximity-based (e.g., BLE, sound) to<br />
location-based approaches (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPS), for only outdoor settings<br />
to indoor settings, using closed-source to open-source counterparts. However,<br />
a wide range of challenges remain unanswered, including methodologies to<br />
improve the penetration and adoption rates, alleviate privacy or expectation<br />
skepticism, ubiquitous availability on low-end terminals as well as<br />
technological/psychological adoption barriers, achieving cross-country<br />
interoperability with standard formations beyond recommendations,<br />
scalability/reliability and accuracy verification of engaged spatial<br />
technologies as well as lessons about effectiveness from real large-scale<br />
deployments.</p>
<p>This special issue intends to bring together transdisciplinary researchers and<br />
practitioners working in topics from multiple areas, e.g., Information<br />
Communication Technologists (geographic information systems, databases,<br />
storage, big data, data mining, machine learning, security/privacy),<br />
Epidemiologists, Medical Practitioners, Psychologists, Emergency Response<br />
and Public safety, among others.</p>

</p></li>
<li><p>Open-source Contact Tracing apps<br />

<p><strong><em>Submissions due: October 31st, 2020</em></strong></p>
<p>We encourage early submission, please check the open submission schedule policy below.</p>
<p>Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.</p>
<p>Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.</p>
<p>This Special Issue invites theoretical and applied cutting edge research on standards, frameworks, models, and approaches on cybersecurity management in the era of AI and intelligent learning technologies. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions on the most recent advances in security network and system management solutions using AI.

<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers:</h2>
<p>The first issue of “Software: Practice and Experience”, published in<br />
1971, reported on applications that could be described in a few thousand<br />
lines of code; today, software systems are among the most complex<br />
entities produced by humans. This growth has spawned new development<br />
methodologies and exposed serious systemic weaknesses.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years, our most pressing problems have moved from the<br />
seven development issues that David Barron focused on in his inaugural<br />
editorial to issues brought about by the scope and ubiquity of our<br />
current applications: Software systems must now be resistant to attack<br />
by malicious agents, and must operate successfully with improper inputs.<br />
Cyber-physical systems must avoid entering states that would damage<br />
equipment or harm people. Applications built as a collection of<br />
cooperating processes must be able to deliver results in a timely<br />
manner, even when the number of simultaneous users fluctuates<br />
significantly. Whether or not these issues can be dealt with by current<br />
design methodology is an open question. Regardless of the answer,<br />
however, Barron’s vision for the journal as a venue for authors to<br />
present their work in a form that will be useful to others remains valid<br />
as we move into the next 50 years.</p>
<p>We invite high quality papers that discuss the development of new ideas,<br />
models, paradigms, and systems evolution appropriate to the challenges<br />
facing the field today. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br />
* Threat models for software systems<br />
* Performance improvement in distributed systems<br />
* Scalability of software<br />
* User interface design<br />
* Workflow management<br />
* Application Programming Models and Environments<br />
* Advances in systems software powering embedded devices to<br />
large-scale computing environments<br />
* Internet-driven Innovative Applications</p>

<p>Special Issue Paper Submission:<br />
*******************************</p>
<p>This special issue seeks submission of papers that present “Software<br />
Systems and Innovations Journey from 1970-2020”. All submissions<br />

<p>Special Issue on</p>
<p>“Design and Management of Reliable</p>
<p>Communication Networks”</p>
<p>Reliability of communication infrastructure is a top priority for network operators. To ensure reliable network operation, new design and management techniques for reliable communications must be constantly devised to respond to the rapid network and service evolution. As a recent and relevant example, deployments of 5G communication networks will soon enter their second phase, during which the network infrastructure will require upgrades to support new Ultra-Reliable services with availabilities of up to 6 nines. Similarly, disaster resiliency in communication networks is now attracting the attention of media, government and industry as never before (consider, e.g., the worldwide network traffic deluge to support remote working during the current Coronavirus pandemic!). Luckily, several new technical directions can be leveraged to provide new solutions for network reliability as (just to name a few): increased network reconfigurability enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN); integration/convergence of multiple technologies (optical, wireless satellite, datacenter networks); enhanced forms of data/service replication, supported by, e.g., edge computing; network slicing, used to carve highly-reliable logical partitions of network, computing and storage resources. These, and many others, technological transformations can be leveraged to enable next-generation high-reliability networks.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest in both industry and academia towards reliability of telecom networks and cloud-computing infrastructures, we organize an IEEE TNSM special issue that aims at timely publication of recent and innovative research results on this important topic. This special issue is organized in collaboration with the International Conference on the Design of Reliable Communication Networks (DRCN), held in Milan in March this year. DRCN is a well-established forum for scientists from both industry and academy who have interest in reliability and availability of communication networks. As such, this special issue will also invite top-scored DRCN papers to share excellent results and new challenges in the field of reliable communication networks and services.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions addressing important challenges (see the non-exhaustive list of topics below) and presenting novel research or experimentation results. Survey papers that offer a perspective on related work and identify key challenges for future research will be considered as well. We look forward to your submissions!</p>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine Special Issue on Advanced Aerial Mobility</p>
<p>(Impact Factor 7.921)</p>
<p>Recent advances in unmanned aviation opened new opportunities for the aviation industry. Encouraged by the successful demonstrations of projects such as the U-Space and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), the aviation industry around the world is moving towards more advanced applications of air mobility including services such as air taxi and air ambulance. At the same time, the academic research community is finding new challenges to address in high-density, low altitude flying UASs.</p>
<p>Advanced aerial mobility refers to “transformative and disruptive new airborne technology supporting an ecosystem designed to transport people and things to locations not traditionally served by current modes of air transportation, including both rural and the more challenging and complex urban environments”, according to the National Academies Press. The platforms that are being developed for advanced aerial mobility applications are typically short-range, runway independent, and highly automated vehicles such as the electric powered Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVToL) aircraft. Along with new platforms, there are new developments emerging in other areas including vertiport design, software, sensors, alternative energy generation and storage solutions. Community testbeds and service frameworks (e.g., Aerial Experimentation Research Platform for Advanced Wireless and U-Space framework for safe and secure access to airspace) are being developed for experimentation of advanced aerial mobility applications around the world.</p>
<p>New challenges are predicted in areas including airspace operations, traffic management, vehicle health integrity monitoring, and human-autonomy teaming, to name a few. In parallel, there is a need for identifying efficient strategies for micro-weather modeling and prediction, collision avoidance in close encounters, detection of uncooperative and rogue aircraft, and geofencing and GPS-denied operation strategies among others. Advances are also required in communication, navigation, and surveillance domains. Airborne communication options ranging from LTE and 5G networks to satellite links, as well as direct and over-the-air radio frequency links using either licensed or unlicensed frequency spectrum need to be investigated.</p>
<p>This special issue aims to share the progress and efforts being made by researchers, practitioners, and regulators towards advanced aerial mobility. This call solicits novel concepts that are currently being pursued or transformative ideas envisioned for this emerging area of research. Original submissions that discuss research, development, experimentation, and evaluation strategies that support advanced aerial mobility are encouraged within the following scope or related areas:</p>
<p>Autonomous air space operations: Flight planning, scheduling, and tracking<br />
Airborne communications: 5G and beyond-5G cellular, satellite, and radio frequency and other (e.g., optical) communication support for UAS, for both air-ground (AG) and air-air (AA)<br />
Aerial platforms: Aerodynamics, power, propulsion, energy efficiency<br />
Command, control, navigation, and surveillance: Aircraft identification, beyond visual line of sight and beyond radio line of sight communication, and navigation in GPS denied areas<br />
Remote Identification (ID) support for UAS using low-power wide-area network technologies: Theoretical/simulation results, analysis, and experiments with technologies such as LoRa, Sigfox, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.X and 5.X, NB-IoT, and ASTM standards for remote ID<br />
Multi-vehicle cooperation: Collision avoidance and conflict management and resolution<br />
Traffic Management: Geofencing, air corridors, and trajectory design and optimization<br />
Human-autonomy and teaming: Best practices and strategies for pilots to interact with unmanned systems in the same air space<br />

<h2 id="important-dates">IMPORTANT DATES</h2>
<p>Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-topics">SCOPE AND TOPICS</h2>
<p>During the last decade, 5G technology has been developed and successfully commercialized for mobile communication networks. 5G technology supports enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication, massive machine type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT), devices and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical devices with IMT-2020 standard aims.</p>
<p>Some key technologies, such as 5G numerology with new radio (NR) waveform in sub- or above 6 GHz (mmWave) bands and MIMO with beamforming, allow those heterogeneous devices or services to overcome their own challenging scenarios. Still, 5G access technology has further challenges, as it is now evolving with convergence technologies, such as autonomously driven vehicles, smart factories, satellite or UAS, public safety, etc. This 5G+ demands more bandwidth, connectivity, and reliability.</p>
<p>Wireless communications in the Terahertz (THz) frequency band and unlicensed bands such as private 5G are considered to provide ultra-high user data rates. Further, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been explored for spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. V2X communication using mmWave side-links is not under-standardized. 5G and 6G now consider interoperation of GEO or LEO satellites and UAS to control autonomous vehicles, including drones, and provide wide-area cells for public safety or content broadcast. This nationwide cell can improve reliability and service continuity. As 5G+ pursues more than low-latency end-to-end access delay (&lt;1 ms), mobile edge computing (MEC) has received attention in terms of supporting the requirements of network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) to improve performance.</p>
<p>This Special Issue will present the most recent advances with respect to the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 5G access communication and its evolution. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit their original manuscripts.</p>
<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sub- or above 6 GHz radio access technologies for 5G+<br />

<p>Motivations<br />
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>
<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Graph-based representations to space and time phenomena;</p></li>
<li><p>Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Multiscale modelling;</p></li>
<li><p>Combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal query languages within GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal GIS interfaces;</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal indoor GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Location-based time GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal web and wireless GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal technologies;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal urban and environmental GIS;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal semantic web;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal data mining.</p></li>

<td>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</td>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:</p>
<p>The technical program committee welcomes paper submissions on all topics related to computer and communication networks. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages, including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS: <a href="https://edas.info/N27861.">https://edas.info/N27861.</a> When submitting a paper, its title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The metadata should be provided before the abstract registration deadline. The program committee may ask some authors to shorten their paper to a short paper of 3 pages to be presented in a poster session, instead of a plenary session.</p>
<p>Instruction on preparing a paper for double-blind review.</p>
<p>Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.<br />
Remove acknowledgments.<br />
Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search.<br />
Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.<br />
Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of “In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that …,” sentences in the spirit of “In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that …” should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as “[1] A. Clark ….,”Analysis of…“, and it is not acceptable to say”[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."<br />
The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.<br />
The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.<br />
Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19</p>
<p>Brief description/Scope</p>
<p>COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.</p>

<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable<br />
development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving,<br />
intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and<br />
enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the<br />
construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning<br />
of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the<br />
sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization.<br />
Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide<br />
alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not<br />
available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming<br />
5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the<br />
massive MIMO technique.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to highlight advances in all aspects of<br />
high-precision positioning in intelligent transportation systems for<br />
different objects, including land vehicles, pedestrians, unmanned aerial<br />
vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles, considering GNSS signals, ground<br />
signals, and their combinations. Up-to-date reviews and original works are<br />
both accepted in this issue. Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-GNSS receivers and emerging navigation satellite<br />
systems;</p></li>
<li><p>Design, prototyping, and testing of positioning devices;</p></li>
<li><p>Detection and mitigation techniques for adverse propagation<br />
conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>5G Positioning;</p></li>
<li><p>Multisensor fusion;</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperative localization;</p></li>

<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.<br />
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.<br />
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.<br />
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.<br />
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.<br />
