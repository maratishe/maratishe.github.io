<p>second Call for Papers</p>
<p>Society 5.0 Conference</p>
<p>Integrating Digital World and Real World to Resolve Challenges in Business and Society</p>
<p>Virtual forum - 22nd to 24th June 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/">https://www.conference-society5.org/</a></p>
<p>We are excited to invite you to submit research papers to our first Society 5.0 Conference.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 can be defined as a human-centered society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems by a system that highly integrates cyberspace (virtual space) and physical (real) space. The aim of Society 5.0 is to create a society where social challenges are resolved by incorporating the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (e.g. Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial intelligence, and the sharing economy) into industry and social life. The term originated in Japan from the government’s Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation and it tackles any aspect of society like healthcare, mobility, infrastructure, politics, government, economy and industry.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 also involves the enormous opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. Problems such as climate change, migration and resource consumption must be solved jointly and globally. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as poverty and education require international efforts. Lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic can have an important impact on dealing with global challenges and crisis situations. Technological advancements and trends for digital transformation should assist us to address these global problems. Convergence of cyberspace and physical space can foster new forms of global cooperation. People, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace. Results obtained by AI can exceed the capabilities of humans and are fed back to physical space.</p>
<p>The conference Society 5.0 is going to deal with the entire range of these opportunities and challenges and show solutions. For a list of topics please refer to the website <a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers">https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers</a></p>
<p>All submissions will be double blind peer-reviewed by an international programme committee, and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer CCIS (Communications in Computer and Information Science) series (final approval pending). CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago and Scopus.</p>

<p>Empowering Sustainable Energy Infrastructures via AI-assisted Wireless Communications<br />
IEEE Wireless Communications<br />
<a href="https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy">https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy</a></p>
<p>Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.</p>
<p>Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.</p>
<p>This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:</p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm</a> FEC</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm</a> FEC</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more<br />
succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for<br />
double-blind reviewing. Detailed submission instructions are available<br />
on the WiSec 2021 website at <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.">https://nyuad.nyu.edu/wisec21.</a></p>
<p>For the first time in WiSec, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge<br />
(SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing<br />
knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an<br />
important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or<br />
challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a<br />
convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps<br />
with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such<br />
contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by<br />
the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.<br />
They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same<br />
standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing<br />
novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the<br />
community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and<br />
included in the proceedings.</p>
<h1 id="posters-and-demos">Posters and demos</h1>
<p>WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to<br />
submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2021 website.</p>
<h1 id="replicability-label">Replicability label</h1>
<p>WiSec will again offer a replicability label for reproducible results.<br />
Authors are encouraged to plan ahead when running their experiments to<br />
minimize the overhead of applying for this label.<br />
The process of reviewing the work for replicability will be largely<br />
similar to the previous years.</p>
<h1 id="double-submissions">Double submissions</h1>
<p>It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions,<br />
where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently<br />
submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions<br />
detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals<br />
involved.</p>
<h1 id="workshops-and-tutorial">Workshops and Tutorial</h1>
<p>ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorial co-organized with the main<br />
conference. Details will be made available on the website.</p>

<p><strong><em>Call for Papers</em></strong></p>
<p>The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications. We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.</p>
