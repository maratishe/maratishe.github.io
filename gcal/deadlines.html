<p>second Call for Papers</p>
<p>Society 5.0 Conference</p>
<p>Integrating Digital World and Real World to Resolve Challenges in Business and Society</p>
<p>Virtual forum - 22nd to 24th June 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/">https://www.conference-society5.org/</a></p>
<p>We are excited to invite you to submit research papers to our first Society 5.0 Conference.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 can be defined as a human-centered society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems by a system that highly integrates cyberspace (virtual space) and physical (real) space. The aim of Society 5.0 is to create a society where social challenges are resolved by incorporating the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (e.g. Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial intelligence, and the sharing economy) into industry and social life. The term originated in Japan from the government’s Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation and it tackles any aspect of society like healthcare, mobility, infrastructure, politics, government, economy and industry.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 also involves the enormous opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. Problems such as climate change, migration and resource consumption must be solved jointly and globally. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as poverty and education require international efforts. Lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic can have an important impact on dealing with global challenges and crisis situations. Technological advancements and trends for digital transformation should assist us to address these global problems. Convergence of cyberspace and physical space can foster new forms of global cooperation. People, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace. Results obtained by AI can exceed the capabilities of humans and are fed back to physical space.</p>
<p>The conference Society 5.0 is going to deal with the entire range of these opportunities and challenges and show solutions. For a list of topics please refer to the website <a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers">https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers</a></p>
<p>All submissions will be double blind peer-reviewed by an international programme committee, and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer CCIS (Communications in Computer and Information Science) series (final approval pending). CCIS is abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago and Scopus.</p>
<p>Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. All submissions must be unpublished and not be under review elsewhere. Page limit for all papers is 12 pages.</p>
<p>Submissions should be made in PDF format using the conference EasyChair submission page.</p>
<p>The conference series will kick off with a virtual forum on 22nd-24th June 2021. In 2022 the Society 5.0 conference will take place in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>Submission deadline: 14th March 2021<br />
Notification of authors: 1st of May 2021<br />
Camera-ready: 15th of May 2021<br />
Virtual forum: 22nd to 24th of June 2021<br />

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm</a> FEC</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

<p>Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.</p>
<p>Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.</p>
<p>This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:</p>

<p>Applied Energy (Impact Factor 8.848) - Special Issue on “Energy Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Network – Moving towards Real Implementation”</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there has been extensive growth in small-scale distributed energy resources (DER), which encompass behind-the-meter generation, energy storage, inverters, electric vehicles, and controllable loads at the household level. These small-scale resources can be utilized not only to manage the energy demand more efficiently but also to enable a significant mix of clean energy into the grid. However, to do so, it is important for the owners of these assets to actively participate in the energy market. As a consequence, peer-to-peer trading has emerged as a next-generation energy management technique for the smart grid that can enable the owners of small scale DERs - also known as prosumers - to actively participate in the energy market. With the prosumers in control of setting the terms of transactions and the delivery of goods and services, it is expected that the gain that the prosumers can reap from participating in peer-to-peer trading would be substantial. At the same time, the grid — consisting of generators, retailers, and distribution network system providers — can also obtain a significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand, lowering investment and operational costs, minimizing reserve requirements, and improving power system reliability.</p>
<p>As a result, a large number of studies have been reported on peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks over the past few years. These studies have focused on a number of important decision-making problems of participants in the virtual layer as well as investigated the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on the physical distribution network. A large number of pilot projects have also been established in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, interestingly, there has been no indication of the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the actual energy market in any country. The purpose of this special section is to address this gap by publishing findings from innovative research that have the potential to establish peer-to-peer sharing in today’s electricity market as an energy trading mechanism. The published articles will demonstrate a set of new research outcomes that can successfully decide on energy trading parameters that are beneficial not only for the prosumers but also for other stakeholders within the market. At the same time, transacted energy by prosumers over the physical layer will not detrimentally impact the physical power system network in terms of violating any constraints and increasing the loss significantly.</p>
<p>The targeted audience includes both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The purpose of the special issue is to provide a platform to enhance interdisciplinary research and share the most recent ideas in the above-related fields. In particular, the published article would cover, but not limited to, the following topics of energy system via designing new peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms:</p>
<p>· Electricity market regulation</p>
<p>· Sharing of energy storage</p>
<p>· Providing demand flexibility to the grid</p>
<p>· Trading of renewable energy in microgrid</p>
<p>· Designing prosumer engagement plans</p>
<p>· Modelling flexibility of distributed energy resources</p>
<p>· Providing voltage and frequency regulation service</p>
<p>· Pricing model</p>
<p>· Minimizing of network loss</p>

<p><a href="https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/">https://ieee-sensors.org/sensors-journal/sensors-journal-special-issues/</a></p>
<p>Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet<br />
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust<br />
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for<br />
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing<br />
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and<br />
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the<br />
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us<br />
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological<br />
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,<br />
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of<br />
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.</p>
<p>This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation<br />
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing<br />
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,<br />
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data<br />
analysis, and applications.</p>

<td>Scope of the Workshop Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g., transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication; transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi; transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism; transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments; SDN and cross-layer transport solutions; new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications; transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and, in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.</td>

<p>Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems are expected to provide a significant increase in data rates, ultra-low latency, enhanced connectivity of a massive number of devices, and improvements in the network energy efficiency. In order to successfully implement and deploy such networks, significant novel contributions and innovations are required in the area of wireless network management.</p>
<p>Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the last 5-10 years have provided a new set of algorithms and tools to solve challenging problems in multiple domains by learning complex relationships directly from data. These kinds of algorithms are also very promising to empower a new generation of fully automated network management mechanisms. However, new challenges emerge, such as deciding when to use traditional management algorithms, AI-based models, or even hybrid approaches; design AI models tailor-made for mobile management problems; decide where they have to be deployed (fog vs. edge); and how to manage their life cycle (from data harvesting to intelligent decision making).</p>
<p>This special issue focuses on novel research in algorithms (especially AI-based) for network management in beyond 5G systems. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for wireless networks and system management using AI. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardisation status, and new future issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel non-AI-based algorithms for network management in B5G systems with benchmarking against their AI-based counterparts using performance metrics such as solution optimality, algorithm complexity, resource demands, energy consumption, etc.<br />
</li>

<p>journal cover imageThe Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to IoMT. IoMT is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge about fifty years ago, CL has grown and developed exponentially.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-based multimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a new research paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. In particular, this special issue will narrow down to focus on multimedia IoT services in real time systems and there are open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL. Moreover, this SI will explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between CL and IoMT applications including multi-model metadata generation, computational content analysis (text services, audio-visual filtering syntactic and semantic interoperability etc).</p>
<p>By organizing this special issue, we aim at presenting recent and significant developments in the applications of CL with IoMT services.</p>

Special Issue on<br />
“Revolutionary Paradigms for Smart Connected Vehicles in the 6G Era”</p>
<h1 id="httpswww.journals.elsevier.comvehicular-communicationscall-for-papersa-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary"><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/vehicular-communications/call-for-papers/a-special-issue-of-vehicular-communications-on-revolutionary</a></h1>
<p>By jointly involving multiple challenging requirements, such as<br />
ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communications, high<br />
efficiency and capacity, intelligent driving is one of the most<br />
ambitious and attractive applications of the 6G initiatives. Although<br />
the convergence of communication, caching, control and computing (4C)<br />
resources can be leveraged to effectively enable 6G services and<br />
applications over vehicle-to-everything (V2X) channels, multiple<br />
challenges must be addressed to allow connected vehicles to meet the<br />
6G requirements, to securely and efficiently orchestrate their<br />
resources and to develop self-organizing and self-sustaining<br />
capabilities.</p>
<p>Emerging communication paradigms that make effective data transmission<br />
in very high dynamic contexts include the reprogrammability of the<br />
environment by the means of Reprogrammable Intelligent Metasurfaces<br />
(RIMs). Moreover, Visible Light Communication (VLC) can improve the<br />
reliability of V2X interactions and be effective in terms of security<br />
and enhanced data rate. With focus on networking aspects, Software<br />
Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) can<br />
bring programmability, flexibility and scalability in connected<br />
vehicles, simplify network management and promote an efficient and<br />
fair use of the distributed 4C resources and programmable<br />
metasurfaces. They can be complemented by revolutionary networking<br />
models, such as Information Centric Networking (ICN), to provide<br />
distributed caching and computing services.</p>
<p>This special issue aims to collect proposals that deal with<br />
revolutionary communication and networking technologies for connected<br />
vehicles, in a holistic fashion or at different layers, to meet the<br />
expectations of the 6G era.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>Software-defined vehicular networks<br />
Vehicular cloud computing in the 6G era<br />
Fog/edge computing architectures for connected vehicles<br />
Integration of SDN/NFV and vehicular cloud computing<br />
Information Centric Networking for Connected Vehicles<br />
Impact of connected vehicles on transportation safety, management,<br />
characterization, and prediction<br />
Mobile sensing networking, sensor data collection and multi-modal fusion<br />
Caching strategies for connected vehicles<br />
Joint management of communication, control, computing and caching for<br />
6G vehicular applications and services<br />
Optical wireless technologies for 6G vehicular applications and services<br />

<p>journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.</p>
<p>Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.</p>
<p>This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.</p>

technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and<br />
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the<br />
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us<br />
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological<br />
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,<br />
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of<br />
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.</p>
<p>This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation<br />
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing<br />
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,<br />
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data<br />
analysis, and applications.</p>

<p>Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.</p>
<p>IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.</p>
<p>The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.</p>

<td>================================ Scope, Aims, and Topics ================================ Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.</td>

<td>Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.</td>

<td>SCOPE: Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</td>

<td>The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement. Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy. The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT. The manuscript submission deadline is 31 January 2022. We will process your paper in time once we receive your submission. For more details please visit the Special Issue website:</td>

<td>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we interact with our devices at home, at work, and throughout our cities. The number of IoT devices that continuously gather data from our environment is exponentially increasing, and so is the amount of data obtained. The potential value of the data is proportional to the capacity of analyzing it and making rapid decisions. Therefore, new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are needed to intelligently let the devices learn, reason, and process the information without human interaction. In this way, the devices become smart, being able to take actions and/or make decisions in real time on their own, as humans do. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a promising paradigm that enables the use of data analytics to optimize a system and generate higher performance by making better decisions in the device itself without using the cloud. In this way, less data needs to be transferred to the cloud and decisions can be made faster. However, limited resources and IoT device capabilities pose significant challenges in supporting AI.</td>

First ideas were presented in the first two 6G special issues published in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine (September 2019 and December 2020, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10209).</a>.) This 6G series will lay down the concepts, basic functionalities, supported services and break-through technologies for 6G networks. The next generation of communications networks will resemble the nervous system making use of new spectrum to create new smart infrastructures that feature proactive, secure and adaptive paradigms that can be enabled by AI/ML. Smart 6G networks should address energy efficiency in the telecommunications’ sector and contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the goals of the European Green Deal, among others. With the increase of large autonomy of systems, the protection of the ‘nervous system’ against malicious attacks becomes also important. Moreover, the system autonomy and the large number of distributed sensor systems demand the simultaneous integration of distributed policies and new energy harvesting concepts. The move to machine-type communication demands radically separation of service processing and probably higher strict KPIs. These technologies and challenges will be considered within the context of 6G networks. This series is sponsored by the IEEE Future Networks initiative and is aimed at helping the research and industrial communities define and shape the architecture, technologies and services for 6G networks. We are soliciting original contributions that have not been published and are not currently under consideration by any other publications or conferences.</td>

<hr />
<p>IEEE LANMAN has an established tradition as a forum for presenting and<br />
discussing the latest technical advances in local and metropolitan area<br />
networking. Cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation<br />
are solicited in all areas of networking. In keeping with the heritage of<br />
the symposium, there will be a central theme, and in 2021 the theme is<br />
“Networking in the New Normal.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world to a new normal. Not only are<br />
research, business, education, and entertainment being shifted online, but<br />
also many of our daily activities are. Recent technological advances in<br />
networking present unique opportunities to bring us to this new normal. At<br />
the same time, they still pose numerous challenges to be addressed, such as<br />
scalable and pervasive connectivity, sustainable networking, and new<br />
application paradigms for online activities.</p>
<p>The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages stimulating<br />
exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be a forum for<br />
discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network access protocols,<br />
network management and control, services and applications. Speculative and<br />
potentially transformative ideas are particularly encouraged, as are<br />
studies reporting measurements from real-life networks and testbeds. Papers<br />
are solicited on any topic in networking, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>Networking for online education and entertainment<br />
Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs<br />
Machine-to-machine communication<br />
Cloud, edge and fog computing integration<br />
Co-existence and heterogeneity support at the edge (HetNets)<br />
Energy efficiency for local and metropolitan area networking<br />
5G and 6G localization, device-free localization, and privacy-aware<br />

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue “Cooperative Perception for Intelligent Vehicles” - Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.275)</p>
<p>Deadline for manuscript submissions: 15 April 2021 (extended).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Intelli_Vechicles">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Intelli_Vechicles</a></p>
<p>Automated vehicles are expected to have a significant impact in the transport sector in the next decades, improving road safety and traffic efficiency, as well as reducing energy consumption and improving user comfort. Automated vehicles make use of a set of onboard sensors installed in the vehicle (e.g. camera, radar and lidar) that are responsible for perceiving the surrounding environment, and a set of actuators that control its longitudinal and lateral movements. One of the development objectives is to automatically perform driving tasks with less or even without driver intervention. Several studies have already shown that the sensors used in the perception process have limitations that might degrade the performance of automated vehicles. For example, in adverse weather conditions (such as rain, snow and fog), the cameras will not be able to adequately capture the environment, and in situations where the sensor’s field of vision is blocked (by other vehicles or buildings) none of the current sensors can detect beyond the position of the obstacle. To overcome these limitations and improve the perception capabilities of the vehicles, cooperative perception enables the wireless exchange of sensor information between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure nodes. Cooperative perception, also known as cooperative sensing or collective perception, enables vehicles and infrastructure nodes to detect objects (e.g. non-connected vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles) beyond their local sensing capabilities. Cooperative perception can be key for extended and timely detection of the surrounding environment and can also enable cooperative applications by compensating low penetration rates of connected road users, thus facilitating the future deployment of automated vehicles.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Special Issue is to present and discuss major research challenges, latest developments, and recent advances on cooperative perception. This Special Issue solicits the submission of high-quality papers from academia and industry that aim to solve open technical problems or challenges in the context of cooperative perception. Original and innovative contributions on all aspects, both theoretical and experimental, are all welcome.</p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website.</p>

<td>SCOPE AND MOTIVATION With the promise of revolutionizing the way we live, work and manufacture, it is no surprise why the Internet of Things (IoT) has picked up the momentum in both industry and academia. Thanks to the increased connectivity and the continued miniaturization of computers and smart devices, IoT will generate huge volumes of data that will have to be analyzed to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. Moreover, in the industrial environments (Industry 4.0) as well in smart spaces (building, houses, etc.) and connected cars communications will require higher reliability, lower latency and scalability. Several technologies such as BLE, Zigbee, WirelessHART, IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH, 6TiSCH, LPWAN (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LTE-M etc.) RAW have been proposed to tackle these requirements. The forthcoming 5G networks promise not only increased data rates but also ultra-low data latency communication for critical IoT applications that require extreme reliability. 5G will enable Machine Type Communication (MTC) one of the most promising technologies for IoT applications which is gaining a tremendous interest among mobile network operators, equipment vendors, MTC specialist companies, and research bodies. This anticipated high-traffic demands, low-latency and deterministic delivery requirements stemming from IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications can be met only with radical changes in terms of architecture and communication solutions. Recently, Fog/Edge-to-thing continuum is proposed to mitigate the heavy burden on the network due to the centralized processing and storing of the massive IoT data. Fog/Edge-enabled IoT architectures ensure closer processing in proximity to the things, which results in small, deterministic latency that enables real-time applications and enforced security. The IoT and Sensor Networks Symposium at IEEE Globecom 2021 aims at a forum that brings together scientists and researchers to present their cutting-edge innovations in all aspects of the field. This track solicits technical papers describing original, previously unpublished papers pertaining to trends, issues and challenges of the Internet of Things.

<p>Motivations</p>
<p>Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,<br />
As Guest Editor, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue “Security Measures in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks” to be published in the journal Electronics (IF 2.412) (ISSN 2079-9292) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/).</p>
<p>The Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is a self-organised ad-hoc network that can be formed by connecting vehicles with other vehicles on the road and with static infrastructure such as crossroads or parking lots. VANET allows its users to share their information and knowledge about road conditions, events, and traffic. Analysing data from this type of network allows road safety to be increased efficiently by controlling crises on the road and supports traffic management thanks to Internet access for drivers and software developers.<br />
However, just like any network, VANET is exposed to attacks and attempts to gain access to data that are generated and transferred between network elements.<br />
Therefore, it has become necessary to design, develop, and extend the appropriate security methods, mechanisms and tools for VANET to protect and secure data exchanged between the network nodes, and, consequently, to secure its users and protect them against incorrect information, misinformation, and delays in information sending.<br />
This Special Issue aims to present a collection of papers that address problems in the methods, mechanisms, and tools for securing the VANETs and their users by exploring aspects such as security design, architectures, deployment, routing, and protocols.<br />
Topics of interest include but not are limited to security methods and mechanics for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication environments, protective methods against any form of security attack (e.g., DoS attack, timing attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Bogus, Sybil, Black, Worm and Gray Hole attack), the security of routing protocols, security and privacy methods for availability, confidentiality, data integration, authentication, and access control.</p>

<p>Call For Papers: Special Track on AI for Tackling Dis/Misinformation<br />
during Pandemics In conjunction with the ACM International Conference<br />
on Information Technology for Social Good (GoodIT 2021)</p>
<p>The GoodIT conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCAS, the Association for<br />
Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Computers &amp; Society.<br />
The conference focuses on the application of IT technologies to social<br />
good.</p>
<p>The Special Track on AI for Tackling Dis/Misinformation during<br />
Pandemics focuses on new data technologies based on artificial<br />
intelligence, data governance, machine learning, natural language<br />
processing, and social network analysis to aid experts in analyzing<br />
large volumes of social media data in order to detect fake news,<br />
misinformation, and disinformation. A number of open challenges need<br />
more investigation from the research community, such as recent trends<br />
in composing information disorder by combining false and real content,<br />
the mechanisms that drive fake content diffusion during pandemics, how<br />
to differentiate fake content from personal viewpoints, why people<br />
tend to believe fake content and make decisions based on it during<br />
pandemics, and what are the different motivations behind the<br />
dissemination of fake content. Fact-checking and claim verification<br />
are two important strategies that are worth incorporating in the<br />
automated tackling and curtailment of fake content during and after<br />
pandemics.</p>

<p>The conference will focus on the application of IT technologies to<br />
social good. Social good is typically defined as an action that provides<br />
some sort of benefit to the general public. In this case, Internet<br />
connection, education, and healthcare are all good examples of social<br />
goods. However, new media innovations and the explosion of online<br />
communities have added new meaning to the term. Social good is now about<br />
global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals,<br />
technology, and collaboration to create positive societal impact.</p>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<hr />
<p>Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.</p>
<p>A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.</p>
<p>Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.</p>

<p>**** Aims and Scope ****</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the cities’ urbanisation has modernised people’s<br />
lives, bringing several benefits to the population. However, it has also<br />
brought serious challenges such as public management of collective<br />
spaces, air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and<br />
quality of life. In this context, Urban Computing emerges as a process<br />
of acquisition, integration, and analysis of a large volume of<br />
heterogeneous data generated from different sources in urban spaces,<br />
such as portable devices, sensors, vehicles, humans, among others. Urban<br />
Computing is an interdisciplinary area that connects information and<br />
communication technology, advanced management of large volumes of data,<br />
and diverse data analysis methods to propose solutions to problems faced<br />
by cities. In addition, Urban Computing seeks to understand the nature<br />
of urban and social phenomena to better plan the future of cities and<br />
improve their inhabitants’ quality of life.</p>
<p>UrbCom aims to create a space for: (1) presentation and discussion of<br />
studies in the area of Urban Computing; (2) collaboration between<br />
researchers from different areas that, given the interdisciplinary<br />
nature, is not limited to Computer Science.</p>
<p>**** Topics of interest (not limited to) ****</p>
<p>Architectures and Protocols for Urban Environments<br />
Data Analysis and Mining<br />
D2D and 5G Communication in Urban Environments<br />
Data Offloading<br />
e-Governance<br />
e-Health and m-Health<br />

<p>SCOPE:<br />
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</p>
<p>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</p>
<p>These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.</p>

<p>Submission due: May 31, 2021</p>
<p>High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to<br />
continuously support<br />
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and<br />
business domains such<br />
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and<br />
financial<br />
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A<br />
number of<br />
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in<br />
the time<br />
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are<br />
developing<br />
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,<br />
and methods that<br />
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.</p>
<p>Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate<br />
predictive<br />
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum<br />
advances in<br />
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific<br />
community. New<br />
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have<br />
also been<br />
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many<br />
problems that<br />
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and<br />
engineering. Training<br />
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing<br />
intensive task that<br />
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era<br />
will be the<br />
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep<br />
learning based<br />
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart<br />
manufacturing,<br />
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.</p>
<p>While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,<br />
renovation in<br />
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance<br />
delivery. The exascale<br />
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI<br />
continue to<br />
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based<br />
system,<br />
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching<br />
towards<br />
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many<br />
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can<br />
seamlessly<br />
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute<br />
resources. We<br />
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and<br />
techniques, performance<br />
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of<br />
application-level<br />
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and<br />
low-level software<br />
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of<br />
exascale in many contexts.</p>

<p>As Guest Editors, we cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue “Cloud-Based IoT Applications for Smart Cities” to be published in the journal Smart Cities (ISSN 2624-6511) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities/).</p>
<p>The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement.<br />
Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy.<br />
The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT.<br />

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Special Issue on “Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods”</p>
<p>MDPI IoT Journal</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).</p>
<p>Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.</p>
<p>For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:<br />
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC<br />
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)<br />
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)<br />
- AI-based methods to optimize mobile EC resources’ placement (e.g., EC capable drones)</p>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Special Issue on “AI Drives Our Future Life”</p>
<hr />
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>While “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) becomes the mainstream of application techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented. AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications, self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI, such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both academic and industrial communities. Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g., cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).</p>
<p>Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation, realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the performance and energy efficiency for various computation and memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI for</p>
<p>various domains to share new findings among the community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.</p>

<p>The Internet, and more generally networks, are today almost mandatory in each application context. They are one of the most important key enablers for applications to be considered as smart, like those used in smart agriculture or smart industry. Since the number of users and connected devices in networks keep growing, more computational and consequently more energy resources are required. This has a big impact on the environment, specifically in pollution driven by electronical components and by the carbon footprint. Over many decades, researchers have started to tackle that problem and to propose sustainable solutions like recycling and exploiting renewable energies. Still, challenges are growing as technologies, infrastructures, architectures, and applications are always evolving, requiring more and more energy. It is worth noticing that the issue is not only a matter of reducing energy consumption but also of more efficiently managing available resources and specifically energy. The smart grid, with new services like storage, can be a key enabler to efficiently manage the energy demand for networks.</p>
<p>This Special Issue calls for original proposals from academia and industry on improving energy efficiency in networks targeting, but not limited to, algorithms, protocols, and architectures.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Energy-efficient networking;<br />
IA energy issues in networks;<br />
Smart grid management/storage service for networks;<br />
Energy-efficient secure networks;<br />
6G energy issues;<br />
Centric-user approaches;<br />
Energy consumption models for physical and virtual network components;<br />
Autonomous vehicles and UAV energy-efficient systems;<br />
Energy-efficient IoT and industrial IoT networks.</p>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>EAI SmartGov 2021 - 3rd EAI International Conference on Smart Governance for Sustainable Smart Cities, November 24-26, 2021</p>
<p>Website: <a href="https://smart-governance.eai-conferences.org/2021/">https://smart-governance.eai-conferences.org/2021/</a></p>
<p>Paper Submission: 1 July 2021</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>Rapid urbanization and social change drives governments to seek out new ways to deliver services and manage cities and drives innovation in processes and policies through smart cities. At the same time, emerging digital technologies offer new ways for local government to understand and monitor the dynamics of the city, respond to the state of the city, carry out administrative tasks and streamline procedures. The complexity of smart cities and settlements means that roles and responsibilities must shift to allow a greater range of stakeholders to contribute to the design and delivery of smart services. This means that smart cities need to find new ways to interact with business, thought-leaders, suppliers, residents, and visitors. Greater transparency and frequent, two-way communication are expected with the co-creation of public services allowing for greater innovation. Advances in data science allow relevant, real-time data to be transformed into useful information to understand urban behavior and infrastructure needs. This can support evidence-based decision making, automated responses and autonomously managed procedures. Realizing this potential, however, raises concerns about privacy and security issues, the resilience of critical information infrastructures, and the unintended consequences as social expectations and behaviors are shaped by algorithms.</p>
<p>In this regard, it is crucial for smart cities to provide trustworthy services which are secure, privacy aware and sustainable. Our aim is to promote the development of secure and sustainable smart cities with smart governance. The SmartGov 2021 will serve as a forum for researchers from academia, government and industries, to exchange ideas, present new results, and provide future visions on these topics.</p>

<h1 id="scope">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been<br />
proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at<br />
enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing,<br />
especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness),<br />
but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for<br />
example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations,<br />
strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move<br />
among different coverage areas<br />
in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce).<br />
Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in<br />
relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise<br />
also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols<br />
suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing<br />
a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches<br />
or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of<br />
theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years,<br />
especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original<br />
quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile<br />
networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm<br />
intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to,<br />
the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their<br />
execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile<br />
networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with<br />
mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.</p>
<p>As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>The topics of the Article Collection include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />
• Automated resource allocation in heterogeneous clusters<br />
• Workload and task scheduling in heterogeneous environments<br />
• Performance optimization and tuning of data-parallel applications<br />
• Automated data management in heterogeneous and emerging storage systems<br />
• Automatic parameter tuning in big data processing systems<br />
• Automatic big data systems tuning that is robust to workload and resource uncertainty<br />
• Query processing, indexing, and optimization in heterogeneous clusters<br />
• Data stream processing in heterogeneous environments<br />
• Automated provisioning of heterogeneous cluster resources<br />
• System administration and manageability</p>
