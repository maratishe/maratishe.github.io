<p>Special Issue Information</p>
<p>Recent improvements in integrated circuit technology have led to the development of new low-cost, tiny sensor nodes. Consequently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being introduced into many different application areas, such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, wearables, transportation, security, surveillance, and other industrial needs. WSNs consist of a large number of self-sustainable, autonomous devices that are able to sense their environment and process and transmit related data. Sensor nodes are commonly hardware-constrained devices that must work under severe resource restrictions such as limited battery, communication, storage, and computing capabilities. In particular, to cope with the scarcity of available energy and to ensure long-term operation, sensor nodes must be designed with low energy radio and sensing units, employ energy efficient communication protocols, and implement optimal energy management policies.<br />
The key for reducing energy consumption in WSNs is the wise utilization of network resources, including power, spectrum, time, and spatial resources. For example, in these networks involving a large number of distributed devices, cooperative power control techniques based on convex optimization or game theory permit governing transmission power efficiently. Furthermore, energy-harvesting technology is frequently used to provide a virtually uninterrupted power supply to the sensor nodes although, due to the intermittent and variable nature of ambient energy sources, accurate prediction schemes of future energy availability may be required to avoid energy shortages.</p>
<p>Energy demands of WSNs can also be reduced, alleviating mutual interference through efficient MAC protocols, employing energy-aware routing algorithms or exploiting available power-saving modes at the sensor nodes. Finally, advanced distributed storage and computation schemes that decrease the number of transmissions and receptions for data collection and dissemination can be adopted to save energy in these networks.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Special Issue is to present the most recent advances, or comprehensive reviews, relating to green wireless sensor networks. Potential topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Energy harvesting;<br />

<p>Smart city is the culmination of applying cutting-edge cyber-physical concepts to city resource management scenarios such as water supply, energy distribution, transportation management and public safety to streamline them for higher operational efficiencies. This is made possible by the tremendous recent advancement in technologies such as cloud computing, computer networking, and Internet of Things. In smart city deployments, sensors and actuators that generate and consume massive volumes of data under diverse formats and ontologies will be integrated into the overall system. The data created by the participating devices need to be appropriately classified and related so that duplication and conflicts can be minimized. To handle the massive volumes of data in a timely manner and to prevent overloads in the cloud infrastructure, newer edge computing paradigms need to be developed.</p>
<p>This special issue mainly focuses on software services and cyber infrastructure of smart cities, addressing both original algorithmic development and new applications. We are soliciting original contributions, of leading researchers and practitioners from academia as well as industry, which address a wide range of theoretical and application issues in this domain.</p>

<ul>
<li>SCOPE<br />
Internet of Things (IoT) has been attracting attention due to its economic impact and high<br />
expectations for drastically changing our societies. Trillion-scale IoT devices including sensors<br />
and actuators are being installed in various “things” such as machines, humans, vehicles, buildings,<br />
and environments. At the same time, we are facing research challenges on how to effectively, timely<br />
and integratedly handle these over trillion flows (which we call Pervasive Flows) gushed from<br />
massive devices or heterogeneous pervasive systems. Based on the success of our previous workshops,<br />
IFoT 2016, PerFoT 2018 and 2019, and PerFlow 2020, the fifth edition, the 2021 International<br />
Workshop on Pervasive Information Flow (PerFlow 2021) aims to present and discuss research<br />
challenges, design/implementations of new architectures, and experiences on timely<br />
processing/distribution of pervasive flows. In addition, interoperability, integration and<br />
coordination among different applications, services and devices should be discussed for real world<br />
deployment of pervasive systems handling pervasive flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>*TOPICS<br />
We solicit technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently<br />
under review by another conference or journal. Submissions should clearly identify how they relate<br />
to issues on pervasive flows gushed from various things. Contributions describing an overall working<br />
system and reporting real world deployment experiences are particularly of interest.</p>
<p>Topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to:<br />
- IoT Device Collaboration and Orchestration<br />
- Mobile Data Offloading<br />
- Data Analysis on IoT Devices<br />
- Data Collection via Crowdsensing etc.<br />
- Machine Learning for Data Stream<br />
- Edge and Fog Computing<br />
- Remote Sensing and Monitoring<br />
- Security and Privacy Issues in Pervasive Systems<br />
- Network Architecture/Protocols/Middleware for Pervasive Systems<br />
- Integration of Services/Protocols/Devices for Pervasive Systems<br />
- Interoperability and Interdependence of Heterogeneous Pervasive Systems<br />
- Quality of Service and Energy-Efficiency of Pervasive Systems</p>
<ul>

<td>Recent advances in unmanned aviation opened new opportunities for the aviation industry. Encouraged by the successful demonstrations of projects such as the U-Space and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), the aviation industry around the world is moving towards more advanced applications of air mobility including services such as air taxi and air ambulance. At the same time, the academic research community is finding new challenges to address in high-density, low altitude flying UASs.</td>

<td>Advanced aerial mobility refers to “transformative and disruptive new airborne technology supporting an ecosystem designed to transport people and things to locations not traditionally served by current modes of air transportation, including both rural and the more challenging and complex urban environments”, according to the National Academies Press. The platforms that are being developed for advanced aerial mobility applications are typically short-range, runway independent, and highly automated vehicles such as the electric powered Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVToL) aircraft. Along with new platforms, there are new developments emerging in other areas including vertiport design, software, sensors, alternative energy generation and storage solutions. Community testbeds and service frameworks (e.g., Aerial Experimentation Research Platform for Advanced Wireless and U-Space framework for safe and secure access to airspace) are being developed for experimentation of advanced aerial mobility applications around the world.</td>

In parallel, there is a need for identifying efficient strategies for micro-weather modeling and prediction, collision avoidance in close encounters, detection of uncooperative and rogue aircraft, and geofencing and GPS-denied operation strategies among others. Advances are also required in communication, navigation, and surveillance domains. Airborne communication options ranging from LTE and 5G networks to satellite links, as well as direct and over-the-air radio frequency links using either licensed or unlicensed frequency spectrum need to be investigated.</td>

<p>Contact Tracing refers to the process of tracking persons who may have come<br />
into spatial contact with an infected person, and subsequently collecting<br />
further information about these contacts. The feature-rich interaction,<br />
processing and localization/communication modalities of smartphone devices,<br />
have brought these to battle on the technological forefront and have curbed<br />
the fast spread of pandemics, like COVID-19, introducing the notion of<br />
“digital vaccines” to custodians aiming at fast prevention rather than<br />
slow intervention.</p>
<p>The community has to this date proposed a wide range of approaches, ranging<br />
from: opportunistic to participatory approaches, privacy-sensitive to<br />
no-privacy approaches, handheld-based (distributed) to cloud-based<br />
(centralized) approaches, proximity-based (e.g., BLE, sound) to<br />
location-based approaches (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPS), for only outdoor settings<br />
to indoor settings, using closed-source to open-source counterparts. However,<br />
a wide range of challenges remain unanswered, including methodologies to<br />
improve the penetration and adoption rates, alleviate privacy or expectation<br />
skepticism, ubiquitous availability on low-end terminals as well as<br />
technological/psychological adoption barriers, achieving cross-country<br />
interoperability with standard formations beyond recommendations,<br />
scalability/reliability and accuracy verification of engaged spatial<br />
technologies as well as lessons about effectiveness from real large-scale<br />
deployments.</p>
<p>This special issue intends to bring together transdisciplinary researchers and<br />
practitioners working in topics from multiple areas, e.g., Information<br />
Communication Technologists (geographic information systems, databases,<br />
storage, big data, data mining, machine learning, security/privacy),<br />
Epidemiologists, Medical Practitioners, Psychologists, Emergency Response<br />
and Public safety, among others.</p>

</p></li>

<p>Motivations<br />
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>
<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;</p></li>

<td>After the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) for scenarios requiring sensor monitoring, the research community has realized that specific environments require narrowing down technological solutions to particular study cases. Examples of these particular scenarios are the recently coined research areas of the Internet of People, Internet of Processes, Internet of Data or Internet of Vehicles, as spin-off fields of the IoT seed. It is understood that future electronics will be inherently connected in what is called the Internet of Everything (IoE), fostering the connectivity of all physical and virtual entities in the Future Internet.</td>

<td>However, the mere collection of sensor records could be useless without a proper treatment of data using, first, an efficient communication medium and, second, a proper infrastructure feeding services and final applications. The evolution from IoT to IoE, and the birth of all other IoX subfields, has lately been coupled with new communication technologies enabling connectivity to battery-powered constrained devices and, even more recently, to moving sensors. Common architectures requiring local communication gateways for Internet connectivity could be inefficient or directly inapplicable when monitoring moving “objects” in open spaces such as cities, maritime areas, agricultural fields or forests.</td>

<p>Throughout history, pandemics have ravaged humanity with plagues and infections that created humanitarian crises, severed social interactions, hindered economic growth, and caused human lives loss. With the most recent COVID-19 outbreak, researchers and practitioners across various domains such as medical and life sciences, economics, and engineering are coming together to put forward solutions to counter such a threat and aid the society in coping with the fallbacks. In the same context, the computing community in general and IoT researchers and practitioners in particular face a challenge about how IoT-based systems can be exploited to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This special issue aims to find answers to some fundamental questions such as what IoT systems, technologies, and infrastructures can be exploited for data and knowledge-driven management of the pandemics, how IoT can enable innovative and unconventional solutions for mitigating outbreaks (through mechanisms such as context-sensitive contact tracing and symptomatic detection, smart lockdowns, crowd-sensed discovery of the emerging clusters), and how IoT can contribute to increased public awareness and safety, and counter the negative emotional and social impact.</p>
<p>This special issue invites technical papers that focus on theoretical and applied research contributions that present original ideas, modeling and simulation results, prototypes, and real-world experiences in the context of IoT for countering pandemics. Interdisciplinary works are most welcome.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Engineering of IoT Systems to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: IoT-driven smart lockdown; context-sensitive contact tracing and symptomatic detection; crowd-sensed identification of the pandemic hotspots; IoT-driven smart health in the time of pandemics; IoT-driven detection of transmission pathways and dose-response effect; data engineering for pandemic IoT systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Algorithms for IoT Systems to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: Context modeling and reasoning applied to pandemics; activity and well-being recognition for early detection of symptoms and monitoring of disease progression; data mining, machine learning and causal reasoning applied to IoT systems to fight pandemics; social and complex networks of IoT devices during pandemics.</p></li>
<li><p>Empirical Research on IoTs to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: Industrial findings and experience reports; validation and evaluation research; measurement studies; systematic mapping studies, or systematic literature reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference Architectures, Infrastructures, and Tools for IoT Systems to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: IoT-driven pandemic management; architectural patterns and styles for pandemic tracing; prototypes and tool support; mobile cloud computing, fog and edge computing; development environments, frameworks, and tools; technological IoT innovations; trust, security, and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Analytical models of IoT Systems to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: performance models of IoT-driven containment and mitigation strategies; analytical studies of required IoT penetration to achieve control of the epidemic; data-driven IoT models and estimation of key parameters to feed into theoretical models.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of IoT Systems to Counter the COVID-19 Pandemic: smart healthcare; smart emergency response systems; smart community and crowd management; food security; smart lockers and innovative choice, pack and delivery methods; unconnected infrastructure and IoT systems.</p></li>

<td>Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks have revolutionized the communication architecture, providing connectivity for people, things, data, applications, transport, and cities in smart networked environments, at faster data rates, reduced latencies, and acceptable costs. The massive number and volume of heterogonous connected devices in such an open space, as well as the advancements in human computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), computing and communication technologies have led to an increasing number of personal and ubiquitous intelligent systems. Such a wide deployment of connected smart technologies introduces new challenges to system security and privacy, mainly for Cyber-physical Systems.</td>

<td>Cyberphysical is a term used for the integration of physical and computing domains as seen in many different areas such as medical, automotive, energy and other critical systems. Nowadays, cyberphysical systems are highly prone to cyber attacks and other forms of security threats at the communication layer due to system high connectivity characteristics. Some of today’s emerging security threats are hard to detect using traditional security and privacy measures and techniques. Therefore, innovative security methods and privacy protection solutions are needed to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving intelligent cyber-physical systems. To achieve this, cybersecurity management systems need to adapt to the changing cyber security threats autonomously with minimal user intervention to provide maximum protection against cyber-attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. AI has the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity and cyberthreat detection. It has received significant interest lately, where a plethora of AI and other intelligent learning solutions such as deep and reinforcement learning are now being integrated into cybersecurity systems to provide more secure and robust privacy-preserving solutions for personal and ubiquitous systems. Such integration will play a vital role in providing enhanced security for intelligent autonomous systems and enables organizations to make crucial changes to their security landscape.</td>

<td>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</td>

Conference on Fog and Edge Computing to be held in Melbourne,<br />
Australia. The conference will be held as part of and in conjunction<br />
with IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2021, which is sponsored by the IEEE Computer<br />
Society and ACM.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />
Billions of devices and sensors ranging from user gadgets to more<br />
complex systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, such as power<br />
grids or vehicles, from the physical world are getting connected to<br />
the Internet. However, the need to operate the scale of heterogeneous<br />
devices and sensors while being performance-efficient in real-time is<br />
challenging. Typically, the data generated by the devices and sensors<br />
are transferred to and processed centrally by services hosted on<br />
geographically distant clouds. This is untenable given the<br />
communication latency incurred and the ingress bandwidth demand.</p>
<p>A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry<br />
experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources<br />
located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the<br />
cloud and the edge. These edge resources may be geographically or in<br />
the network topology be closer to devices and sensors, such as home<br />
router, gateways or more substantial micro data centers. Edge<br />
resources may be used to offload selected services from the cloud to<br />
accelerate an application or host edge-native applications. The<br />
paradigm within which the edge is harnessed is referred to as<br />
‘Fog/Edge computing’.</p>
<p>The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of<br />
service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing,<br />
and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between<br />
these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources,<br />
which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization<br />
and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management.<br />
Extensions to current programming and storage models are required and<br />
new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel<br />
applications that can benefit from massively distributed and<br />
data-driven systems need to be developed. Addressing security, privacy<br />
and trust of the edge resources is of paramount importance while<br />
managing the resources and context for mobile, transient and hardware<br />
constrained resources. Lastly, emerging domains like autonomous<br />
vehicles and machine/deep learning need to be supported over such<br />
platforms.</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering<br />
both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific<br />
applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use<br />
the edge. Some representative topics of interest include, but are not<br />
limited to:<br />
* Data centers and infrastructures for Fog/Edge computing<br />
* Middleware and runtime systems for Fog/Edge infrastructures<br />
* Programming models for Fog/Edge computing<br />
* Storage and data management platforms for Fog/Edge computing<br />
* Scheduling for Fog/Edge infrastructures<br />
* Distributed and federated machine learning on Fog/Edge<br />
* Performance monitoring and metering of Fog/Edge infrastructures<br />
* Legal issues and business aspects of Fog/Edge computing<br />
* Security, privacy, trust and provenance issues in Fog/Edge computing<br />
* Modeling and simulation of Fog/Edge environments<br />
* Novel, latency-sensitive and locality-critical applications of<br />
Fog/Edge computing</p>

<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:</p>
<p>The technical program committee welcomes paper submissions on all topics related to computer and communication networks. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), with a maximum length limit of 9 printed pages, including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS: <a href="https://edas.info/N27861.">https://edas.info/N27861.</a> When submitting a paper, its title, all co-authors, and a concise abstract of up to 200 words should be provided to EDAS as the metadata of the paper. The metadata should be provided before the abstract registration deadline. The program committee may ask some authors to shorten their paper to a short paper of 3 pages to be presented in a poster session, instead of a plenary session.</p>
<p>Instruction on preparing a paper for double-blind review.</p>
<p>Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.<br />
Remove acknowledgments.<br />
Remove project titles or names that could be used to trace back to the authors via web search.<br />
Carefully name your files to anonymize author information.<br />
Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of “In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that …,” sentences in the spirit of “In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that …” should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as “[1] A. Clark ….,”Analysis of…“, and it is not acceptable to say”[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."<br />
The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.<br />
The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.<br />
Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.</p>
<p>At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC co-chairs grant permission for a substitute presenter before the conference. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final correctly formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IFIP Digital Library and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To ensure appropriate consideration of conflicts of interest during the review process, changes to the list of authors are prohibited once a paper has been submitted for review. Should a paper be accepted, the complete list of authors, including the order of authors, must remain identical as the EDAS metadata in the final camera-ready manuscript.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Mobile and Edge Computing Systems<br />
The ubiquitous deployment of mobile computing platforms and embedded Internet of Things devices have catalyzed the development of various computing services deeply embedded to our everyday lives. Recently with relatively more powerful edge platforms, computationally heavy tasks that could not be previously enabled using resource limited mobile and embedded platforms can be realized to enable a richer set of localized services. The combination of mobile and edge computing systems has enabled the use of tasks such as various deep learning techniques and computationally heavy blockchains to mobile and embedded computing scenarios, but have also introduced new challenges related to utilizing the limited resources, maintaining user privacy and preserving energy efficiency.<br />
The objective of this special issue is to explore recent advances in mobile and edge computing systems to address practical and fundamental challenges. Networking, security, and AI-based schemes to support mobile and edge computing systems as well as application designs are all potential topics that can collectively tackle such challenges. Specifically, potential topics include but are not limited to the following:<br />
● Intelligent deployment of mobile and edge computing systems<br />
● Deep learning technologies for mobile and edge computing<br />

INTELLIGENT &amp; RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD<br />
<a href="https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/">https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2021/</a><br />
JULY 12-16, 2021</p>
<p><strong><em>CALL FOR PAPERS</em></strong></p>
<p>Computers, Software, and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis. Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication. Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely. These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities. But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered. Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently. In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses. As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported. How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing. How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users? For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!</p>
<p>COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.</p>
<p><strong><em>SUBMISSION</em></strong></p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 &amp; C1J2 program.

<p><strong><em>Call for Papers</em></strong></p>
<p>Current communication networks are increasingly becoming pervasive, complex, and ever-evolving due to factors like enormous growth in the number of network users, continuous appearance of network applications, increasing amount of data transferred, and diversity of user behaviors. Understanding and measuring traffic in such networks is a difficult yet vital task for network management but recently also for cybersecurity purposes. Network traffic measuring and monitoring can, for example, enable the analysis of the spreading of malicious software and its capabilities or can help to understand the nature of various network threats including those that exploit users’ behavior and other user’s sensitive information. On the other hand network traffic investigation can also help to assess the effectiveness of the existing countermeasures or contribute to building new, better ones. Recently, traffic measurements have been utilized in the area of economics of cybersecurity e.g. to assess ISP “badness” or to estimate the revenue of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research accomplishments provided by researchers from academia and the industry. The other goal is to show the latest research results in the field of cybersecurity and understand how traffic measurements can influence it. We encourage prospective authors to submit related distinguished research papers on the subject of both: theoretical approaches and practical case reviews. This workshop presents some of the most relevant ongoing research in cybersecurity seen from the traffic measurements perspective. The workshop will be accessible to both non-experts interested in learning about this area and experts interested in hearing about new research and approaches.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19</p>
<p>Brief description/Scope</p>
<p>COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.</p>

<p>** CALL FOR PAPERS ** IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop: Emerging Topics in 6G Communications</p>
<p>Workshop website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home">https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home</a></p>
<p>Venue: International Workshop on Emerging Topics in 6G Communications (ET_6G) which will be held at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC2021) on 14 June 2021.</p>
<p>5G networks and devices are now a reality with wide deployment and spread among population, but the demand for more data rate is still booming, and will soon need for a newer generation for wireless/cellular communication, the 6G. It will be a new standard that not only provides huge data rate (+1Tbps) and extremely low delay (0.1ms), but also will enable the “hyper-connected” paradigm that will connect users and things. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a major role within 6G, and thus more computation and communication resources will be consumed, where their optimization is a must.</p>
<p>6G communications will bring new challenges due to their sensitivity to scenario conditions, thereby requiring highly adaptive techniques that will adapt extremely fast, in order to guarantee a delay less than 100 microseconds. Spectrum and resources management will be crucial within 6G in order to account for the extremely heterogeneous scenario. The networks complexity will also be unprecedented, due to the very diverse applications such as ultra‐low latency requirements for critical vehicle communication, the growing demand of high positioning accuracy for location‐based services, and dense heterogeneous architectures. Several emerging topics are encountered within 6G and this workshop will focus on such emerging topics, and potential solutions will be presented. Researchers and engineers from academia and industry are invited to submit their recent results and innovations. The list of topics includes, but not restricted to the following topics:</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for 6G communications.<br />
Novel signal processing techniques for 6G communications.<br />
Smart Antenna schemes for 6G communications.<br />
6G communications at the Terahertz band.<br />
Advanced Full Duplex strategies for 6G.<br />

<p>We invite contributions to a Special Issue on AI for People, to be published by the AI &amp; Society - Journal of Culture, Knowledge and Communication (Springer) <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.">https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.</a></p>
<p>This Special Issue was born out of the idea of shaping Artificial Intelligence technology around human and societal needs. We believe that technology should respect the anthropocentric principle. It should be at the service of the people, not vice-versa. In order to foster this idea, we need to narrow the gap between civil society and technical experts. This gap is one in knowledge, in action and in tools for change.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>SPECIAL ISSUE THEMES</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>The ‘social good’ is something which benefits the general public, being ‘for’ the people, and at the same time, it is something which reflects and respects their wishes, being ‘from’ the people. The ‘social good’ can be envisioned as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals through collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approaches to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned ‘social good’, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development and sustainability.</p>
<p>Nowadays, advances in research on AI systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse about the applicability of the AI Ethics principles when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems. AI Ethical principles are guidelines put forward by policy makers that can act as abstractions, as normative constraints on the do’s and don’ts of algorithmic use in society. Themes of transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy must be taken into account when deploying real-world AI systems.</p>
<p>This Special Issue will focus on the following AI Ethics principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accuracy and Robustness: algorithmic conclusions are probabilities and therefore not infallible and they also might incur in errors during execution. This can lead to unjustified actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Explainability and Transparency: a lack of interpretability and transparency can lead to algorithmic systems that are hard to control, monitor, and correct. This is the commonly called ‘black-box’ issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Bias and Fairness: conclusions can only be as reliable (but also as neutral) as the data they are based on, and this can lead to bias. An action could be found to be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on one group of people.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy: algorithmic activities, like profiling, can lead to challenges for autonomy and informational privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Accountability: it is hard to assign responsibility to algorithmic harms and this can lead to issues with moral responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety and Security: AI systems need to respect and support privacy rights and data protection while ensuring the security of data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of this Special Issue is, however broad, mostly twofold. On one hand, it entails the technical realization of these AI Ethics principles (one or more) in practice. For example, this might refer to specific techniques to ensure principles like ‘fairness’ in an algorithm, with their related practical challenges. On the other hand, it entails addressing these principles from a conceptual standpoint. For example, this might entail, among other things, theorizing, analysing, criticizing and/or further developing the AI principles themselves. Contributions are welcomed from a host of different disciplines, spanning from the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.</p>

<td>Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving, intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization. Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming 5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the massive MIMO technique.</td>

<td>Critical Infrastructures are defined as “assets, systems or part thereof which are essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.” Critical Infrastructures refer to a multitude of sectors, including energy, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare and public safety. Systems deployed within these sectors integrate both information technologies and operational technologies, being commonly reliant on legacy industrial control and cyber-physical systems. Nevertheless, novel disruptive and enabling information and communication technologies are increasingly integrated, increasing connectivity and interdependencies, thus presenting security professionals with significant challenges in maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of such infrastructures.

<hr />
<h1 id="scope">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.<br />
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.<br />
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.<br />
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.<br />
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.<br />
Keywords</p>
<p>GNSS<br />
Urban applications<br />
Multipath, NLOS<br />
Hybridization, multisensor fusion<br />
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)<br />

<p>journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.</p>
<p>Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.</p>
<p>This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -</p>
<p>JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING</p>
<p>WEBSITE:<br />
<a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future</a></p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</p>
<p>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</p>
<p>These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.</p>

<p>Many services, such as personal navigation, search and rescue, robot and fleet<br />
management, healthcare would greatly benefit from ubiquitous, accurate, robust<br />
and seamless positioning technologies. While mature GNSS solutions exist for<br />
outdoor spaces, more than ten years of research and development of sensing<br />
technologies have not yet led to a widely available offer of generic and<br />
affordable standard solutions for indoors. Nonetheless, year after year the<br />
insight that researchers have offered into indoor localization provides us<br />
with more methods and the array of usable sensors widens with technological<br />
progress. Hybridization of sensors data, smart capture of environmental data,<br />
benchmarking of sensing and positioning technologies are all at the heart of<br />
indoor positioning and indoor navigation innovations.</p>
<p>This Special Issue of the IEEE Sensors Journal is devoted to the presentation<br />
of innovations and improvements in the field of advanced sensors and sensing<br />
technologies for indoor positioning and navigation including theory, design,<br />
modelling, configuration, characterization, sensor data processing, data<br />
analysis, and applications.</p>
