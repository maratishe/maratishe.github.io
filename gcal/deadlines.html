<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.<br />
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.<br />
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.<br />
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.<br />
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.<br />
Keywords</p>
<p>GNSS<br />
Urban applications<br />
Multipath, NLOS<br />
Hybridization, multisensor fusion<br />
Detection technics (statistical tests, machine learning, etc.)<br />

<p>The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021)<br />
IEEE-CS TCI</p>
<p>23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ficloud.org/2021/">http://www.ficloud.org/2021/</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.</p>
<p>IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.</p>
<p>The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.</p>

<p>================================<br />
Scope, Aims, and Topics<br />
================================<br />
Many fields of science have been experiencing and continue to experience a large influx of data. Managing, transporting, and architecting systems, as well as building tools to deal with the delivery of these data have become increasingly important. Additionally, the ecosystem of information and communication systems is becoming more complex. Wide area networks are now an integral and essential part of this data-driven supercomputing ecosystem connecting information sources, data stores, processing, simulation, visualization and user communities together. Furthermore, networks are required to connect research instruments such as photon sources and large visualization displays.</p>
<p>Networks for data-intensive science have more extreme requirements than general-purpose networks. These requirements not only closely impact the design of processor interconnects in supercomputers and cluster computers, but they also impact campus networks, regional networks and national backbone networks. The developments in network technologies are tremendous. Speeds of many hundreds of Gigabits and deep programmability of network infrastructure are now common. This enables a fundamentally different approach of integrating networks in supercomputing applications.</p>
<p>The INDIS 2020 workshop (https://scinet.supercomputing.org/community/indis/), held virtually in conjunction with the Supercomputing Conference in November 2020, provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the above topics.</p>

<p>THIRD WORKSHOP ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET TRANSPORT (FIT 2021)<br />
<a href="https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit">https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/third-workshop-on-the-future-of-internet-transport-fit</a></p>
<p>Dear all</p>
<p>The Third Workshop on the Future of Internet Transport will be held on 21st June 2021 in conjunction IFIP Networking 2021. Please see the Call for Papers below and consider submitting your novel research papers to this workshop.</p>
<p>Scope of the Workshop<br />
Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g.,<br />
transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication;<br />
transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi;<br />
transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism;<br />
transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments;<br />
SDN and cross-layer transport solutions;<br />
new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications;<br />
transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and,<br />
in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest<br />
FIT 2021 topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />
Solutions to the Internet transport layer ossification (e.g., QUIC, TAPS)<br />
Scalable, deployable, extensible and flexible transport protocol and service solutions for future networks (e.g., in 5G, Wi-Fi6, vehicular networks)<br />

Web-based transport services (e.g., HTTP/2 and HTTP/3)<br />
Novel congestion control schemes (e.g. coupled, delay-based, ECN based, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT based (e.g., BBR), model based)<br />
Design and performance of transport protocols in userland<br />
Transport protocols and solutions for multimedia traffic (e.g., WebRTC, MPRTP, RTMFP)<br />
Standardization of transport protocols and services (e.g., IETF TAPS)<br />
Transport protocols performance in the virtualized and containerized environment<br />

<p><strong><em>Call for Papers</em></strong></p>
<p>The surging demand for bandwidth and the increasing heterogeneity of services are posing substantial new challenges in networking. Emerging paradigms based on the softwarization, virtualization, cloudification of the network infrastructures are fostering exciting changes in the ways we build and manage such systems. In particular, they force us to re-think traffic measurement and analysis across the whole stack, from the physical layer up to applications in the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA) aims at being a highly selective venue for the presentation of early-stage and mature research – as well as controversial work – on all aspects of both measurement and analysis of network traffic. The TMA conference has a strong tradition of open and lively interaction among scientists and engineers in academia and industry, and serves as a premier forum to exchange ideas, and present advances over the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>TMA 2021 invite submissions presenting concepts, experiences, and of course results in collection, processing, analysis and visualization of network traffic data, which may address performance enhancement, monitoring, management, security, privacy or other uses of network data. The focus is on improving the practice or application of network measurements across the entire network stack up to application layers, with an emphasis on new areas of network communication such as Network Function Virtualization, Software-Defined Networks, Cloud services, data centers or Content Distribution Networks, towards as to support innovative services and applications. We also welcome more traditional measurement topics, such as traffic classification, anomaly detection, network performance evaluation and traffic analysis.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traffic measurement, analysis, characterization, visualization and classification</p></li>
