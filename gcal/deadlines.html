<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.<br />
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.<br />
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.<br />
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.<br />
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.<br />
Keywords</p>
<p>GNSS<br />
Urban applications<br />
Multipath, NLOS<br />
Hybridization, multisensor fusion<br />

<p>The 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021)<br />
IEEE-CS TCI</p>
<p>23-25 August 2021, Rome, Italy</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ficloud.org/2021/">http://www.ficloud.org/2021/</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Cloud is a modern computing platform for delivering on-demand computing services to service consumers over the Internet. Computing services include, for example, storage, memory, compute power, databases, and networking among others. Cloud services are generally provided using SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). Unlike conventional distributed computing, cloud offers flexibility, scalability, efficiency and elasticity in service provisioning.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a dynamic and global network infrastructure which is characterized by intelligent and self configuring capabilities. IoT is considered as an integral part of the future Internet. It is based on interoperable communication protocols in order to enable the interaction and integration of virtual as well as physical Things such as computers, smart devices, sensors, cars, refrigerators, food packages, medicines, etc. Things can be seamlessly integrated into the information network and interaction can be made through the provision of intelligent interfaces. In not so distant future, IoT will be forcing its way into every aspect of our lives and technologies including smart homes, smart cities, environment and nature, green energy, food, medicine, automotive, aerospace and aviation, telecommunication, and so on.</p>
<p>IoT is generally characterized by real world and small Things, limited capacity, constrained devices and the consequential issues such as less reliability, security and privacy. Cloud computing on the other hand deals mainly with virtual world and has unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power. Thus cloud and IoT are the main complementary aspects of the future Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Similarly, cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner.</p>
<p>The theme of this conference is to promote the state of the art in scientific and practical research of the IoT and cloud computing. It provides a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public sector in an effort to present their research work and share research and development ideas in the area of IoT and cloud computing.</p>

<td>Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving, intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization. Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming 5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the massive MIMO technique.</td>

<td>The Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a major architectural paradigm for achieving machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. The fundamental principle behind IoT is the concept of a “resource” (or a “thing”), that serves as an abstraction of a basic unit that interacts with its environment, and is capable of providing services, data and control elements to other internetworked resources. Many IoT scenarios can be characterized by lots of (small) traffic, lots of entities, strong heterogeneity in links and device capabilities, strong distribution, and highly sensitive data. Individual nodes have limited compute resources and on-device storage (e.g., consider Raspberry Pi single board computers). Their connectivity is often constrained by factors such as the presence of NATs and firewalls, power constraints, and intermittent network access.</td>

<p>THIRD WORKSHOP ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET TRANSPORT (FIT 2021)<br />

<p>Dear all</p>
<p>The Third Workshop on the Future of Internet Transport will be held on 21st June 2021 in conjunction IFIP Networking 2021. Please see the Call for Papers below and consider submitting your novel research papers to this workshop.</p>
<p>Scope of the Workshop<br />
Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g.,<br />
transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication;<br />
transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi;<br />
transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism;<br />
transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments;<br />
SDN and cross-layer transport solutions;<br />
new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications;<br />
transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and,<br />
in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest<br />
FIT 2021 topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />
Solutions to the Internet transport layer ossification (e.g., QUIC, TAPS)<br />

TCP/UDP/IP extensions for richer transport services<br />
Opportunistic use of QoS mechanisms (e.g., DSCP usage in WebRTC)<br />
Less-than-best-effort transport protocols and services<br />
Transport selection mechanisms (e.g., happy-eyeballing)<br />
Transport layer security (e.g., TLS 1.3)<br />
Web-based transport services (e.g., HTTP/2 and HTTP/3)<br />
Novel congestion control schemes (e.g. coupled, delay-based, ECN based, Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT based (e.g., BBR), model based)<br />
Design and performance of transport protocols in userland<br />
Transport protocols and solutions for multimedia traffic (e.g., WebRTC, MPRTP, RTMFP)<br />
Standardization of transport protocols and services (e.g., IETF TAPS)<br />
Transport protocols performance in the virtualized and containerized environment<br />
Performance of transport protocols in cloud/edge environments and with latency sensitive and bandwidth-hungry applications (e.g. AR/VR in automotive).<br />
Novel Internet transport architectures</p>

<p>Call for Paper</p>
<p>Since the development of Cloud Computing technology has deeply changed not only the development of computer science but also influenced the way people live. With Cloud-based technology, various kinds of mobile applications to big data-based services are provided to accelerate the data-oriented services. Today, one of the most promising trends is the Cloud-based solutions for small enterprises to deploy their business on Cloud servers. However, privacy and security issues along with the widely developed Cloud-based services are always becoming an obstacle for the usage of the Cloud services. Also, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies such as Deep Learning (DL) have brought new challenges to the traditional security and privacy issues on Cloud Computing. IEEE CSCloud 2020 focuses on these two aspects and aims to gather recent achievements in cybersecurity and cloud computing fields. The conference invites those papers that concentrate on new paradigms, algorithms, and applications in cybersecurity or cloud computing. We also encourage researchers and practitioners to build up the connections between academia and industry. We aim to collect the latest achievements and exchange research ideas in the domains of intelligent data and security at this academic event.</p>
<p>IEEE CSCloud 2021 is co-located with The 7th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2021)</p>

<p>** CALL FOR PAPERS ** IEEE ICC 2021 Workshop: Emerging Topics in 6G Communications</p>
<p>Workshop website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home">https://sites.google.com/view/ieeeiccworkshop/home</a></p>
<p>Venue: International Workshop on Emerging Topics in 6G Communications (ET_6G) which will be held at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC2021) on 14 June 2021.</p>
<p>5G networks and devices are now a reality with wide deployment and spread among population, but the demand for more data rate is still booming, and will soon need for a newer generation for wireless/cellular communication, the 6G. It will be a new standard that not only provides huge data rate (+1Tbps) and extremely low delay (0.1ms), but also will enable the “hyper-connected” paradigm that will connect users and things. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a major role within 6G, and thus more computation and communication resources will be consumed, where their optimization is a must.</p>
<p>6G communications will bring new challenges due to their sensitivity to scenario conditions, thereby requiring highly adaptive techniques that will adapt extremely fast, in order to guarantee a delay less than 100 microseconds. Spectrum and resources management will be crucial within 6G in order to account for the extremely heterogeneous scenario. The networks complexity will also be unprecedented, due to the very diverse applications such as ultra‐low latency requirements for critical vehicle communication, the growing demand of high positioning accuracy for location‐based services, and dense heterogeneous architectures. Several emerging topics are encountered within 6G and this workshop will focus on such emerging topics, and potential solutions will be presented. Researchers and engineers from academia and industry are invited to submit their recent results and innovations. The list of topics includes, but not restricted to the following topics:</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for 6G communications.<br />

<td>Network traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade thanks to the advances in smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Not only the volume of the traffic is increasing, the characteristics of the traffic are also becoming more diverse. To properly manage traffic diversity, different but coherent strategies are needed at different protocol layers, and this often results in complex designs in the network which are difficult to deploy and manage. The recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a promising approach to deal with complex problems faced in the network and/or systems design and operation. The trend towards highly integrated networks with diverse underlying access technologies to support simultaneously multiple vertical industries has demanded complex operation in the network and/or systems.

INTELLIGENT &amp; RESILIENT COMPUTING FOR A COLLABORATIVE WORLD<br />

JULY 12-16, 2021</p>
<p><strong><em>CALL FOR PAPERS</em></strong></p>
<p>MAIN CONFERENCE PAPER SUBMISSION DUE DATE EXTENDED TO JANUARY 30, 2021</p>
<p>Computers, Software and Applications. It is a major international forum for academia, industry, and government to discuss research results and advancements, emerging challenges, and future trends in computer and software technologies and applications. The theme of COMPSAC 2021 is “Intelligent and Resilient Computing for a Collaborative World”.The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we work with each other on a regular basis. Limitations on in-person interactions have caused a dramatic increase in our use and reliance on collaborative technology to enable normal communication. Family and friends have conversations via video chat, students utilize online learning instead of in-person instruction, and medical professionals treat patients remotely. These are only a few examples of how interactive software and applications have provided the foundation for continued normal day-to-day activities. But as use of these tools has rapidly accelerated, some limitations and shortcomings have also been discovered. Many components support online collaborative services, including bare-metal hardware, massive back-end storage, and high-speed, high-throughput networking, as well as the software required to administer these components efficiently. In many cases, the resilience of these underpinnings has been tested by unprecedented levels of demand, stressing systems and exposing weaknesses. As computer researchers, we see these weaknesses as opportunities to fill gaps in how software and applications are developed, utilized, and supported. How to improve the resiliency of these components across a wide range of use domains is a significant challenge we suddenly find ourselves facing. How do we design systems that are able to withstand the stress of global-scale use, and still provide robust and secure services to end-users? For over 40 years, COMPSAC has been an outlet for researchers to share and discuss innovative and novel approaches to problems such as these, and we look forward to hearing your ideas in 2021!</p>
<p>COMPSAC 2021, organized as a tightly integrated union of symposia, will focus on technical aspects of issues relevant to computers, software and applications, with an emphasis on topics related to improving collaboration with intelligence and resilience. The technical program will include keynote addresses, research papers, industrial case studies, fast abstracts, a doctoral symposium, poster sessions, and workshops and tutorials on emerging and important topics related to the conference theme. Highlights of the conference will include plenary and specialized panels that will address the technical challenges facing researchers and practitioners who are driving fundamental changes in intelligent systems and applications. Panels will also address cultural and societal challenges with respect to computing and collaboration raised by rapidly changing communication norms.</p>
<p><strong><em>SUBMISSION</em></strong><br />
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research work, as well as industrial practice reports. Simultaneous submission to other publication venues is not permitted except as highlighted in the COMPSAC 2021 J1C2 &amp; C1J2 program.

<td>Today, new forms of distributed environments beyond Cloud Computing occur that offer new kinds of applications, but pose new challenges for data management. The recent efforts for serverless computing aim at simplifying the process of deploying code in the Cloud into production by hiding scaling, capacity planning and maintenance operations from the developer or operator. Other initiatives work on avoiding the communication to the Cloud by deploying and running environments for data processing near data sources in Internet-of-Things scenarios (e.g., fog and edge computing) for large-scale smart homes, companies and cities, and near the applications (e.g., Cloudlets for mobile applications and Offline First technologies for web applications).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Research on distributed data management evolves addressing new challenges specific to these new environments. Properties of emergent distributed environments regarding capabilities of nodes, bandwidth for communication, battery lifetime of nodes, reliability of nodes and communication, and heterogeneity of configurations impact data management mechanisms and approaches, such as those for fault tolerance, replication, resource provisioning, buffer management, query processing and optimization, and transaction management. In addition, federated approaches and polystores spanning over several emergent distributed environments are also remaining research challenges based on the need for combining these different distributed environments into one distributed runtime environment for easy handling of Big Data in different models and globally optimizing data management tasks across these different environments.</td>

<td>The workshop solicits papers of different categories: - Research Papers propose new approaches, theories or techniques related to Big Data in emergent distributed environments including new data structures, protocols and algorithms. They should make substantial theoretical and empirical contributions to the research field. - System Papers describe new data management tools, stream processing engines, databases and other systems, which are able to handle Big Data in emergent distributed environments. - Experiments and Analysis Papers focus on the experimental evaluation of existing approaches including data structures and algorithms for Big Data in emergent distributed environments and bring new insights through the analysis of these experiments. Results of Experiments and Analysis Papers can be, for example, showing benefits of well-known approaches in new settings and environments, opening new research problems by demonstrating unexpected behavior or phenomena, or comparing a set of traditional approaches in an experimental survey. - Application Papers report practical experiences on applications of Big Data in emergent distributed environments. Application Papers might describe how to apply technologies to specific application domains with big data demands in emergent distributed environments like social networks, web search, e-business, collaborative environments, e-learning, medical informatics, bioinformatics and geographic information system. - Vision Papers identify emerging new or future research issues and directions, and describe new research visions having demands for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. The new visions will potentially have great impacts on society. - Demo Papers deal with innovative systems and applications for Big Data in emergent distributed environments. These papers describe a showcase of the proposed system/application, but may also explain the novelty of the system’s architecture. We are especially interested in demonstrations having a WOW-effect. The length of papers must be within 4 pages to 6 pages. Accepted papers will be presented as oral presentations.</td>

These include respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if human subjects are involved or other people are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report (https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) and the ACM ethics policy (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007 (http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.</td>

<td>INTRODUCTION Billions of devices and sensors ranging from user gadgets to more complex systems with sensing and actuating capabilities, such as power grids or vehicles, from the physical world are getting connected to the Internet. However, the need to operate the scale of heterogeneous devices and sensors while being performance-efficient in real-time is challenging. Typically, the data generated by the devices and sensors are transferred to and processed centrally by services hosted on geographically distant clouds. This is untenable given the communication latency incurred and the ingress bandwidth demand.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A new and disruptive paradigm spear-headed by academics and industry experts is taking shape so that applications can leverage resources located at the edge of the network and along the continuum between the cloud and the edge. These edge resources may be geographically or in the network topology be closer to devices and sensors, such as home router, gateways or more substantial micro data centers. Edge resources may be used to offload selected services from the cloud to accelerate an application or host edge-native applications. The paradigm within which the edge is harnessed is referred to as ‘Fog/Edge computing’.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The Fog/Edge computing paradigm is expected to improve the agility of service deployments, make use of opportunistic and cheap computing, and leverage the network latency and bandwidth diversities between these resources. Numerous challenges arise when using edge resources, which requires the re-examination of operating systems, virtualization and containers, and middleware techniques for fabric management. Extensions to current programming and storage models are required and new abstractions that will allow developers to design novel applications that can benefit from massively distributed and data-driven systems need to be developed. Addressing security, privacy and trust of the edge resources is of paramount importance while managing the resources and context for mobile, transient and hardware constrained resources. Lastly, emerging domains like autonomous vehicles and machine/deep learning need to be supported over such platforms.</td>

<td>CALL FOR PAPERS The conference seeks to attract high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice over system software and domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that use the edge.

<p>High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to<br />
continuously support<br />
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and<br />
business domains such<br />
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and<br />
financial<br />
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A<br />
number of<br />
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in<br />
the time<br />
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are<br />
developing<br />
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,<br />
and methods that<br />
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.</p>
<p>Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate<br />
predictive<br />
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum<br />
advances in<br />
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific<br />
community. New<br />
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have<br />
also been<br />
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many<br />
problems that<br />
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and<br />
engineering. Training<br />
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing<br />
intensive task that<br />
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era<br />
will be the<br />
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep<br />
learning based<br />
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart<br />
manufacturing,<br />
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.</p>
<p>While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,<br />
renovation in<br />
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance<br />
delivery. The exascale<br />
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI<br />
continue to<br />
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based<br />
system,<br />
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching<br />
towards<br />
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many<br />
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can<br />
seamlessly<br />
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute<br />
resources. We<br />
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and<br />
techniques, performance<br />
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of<br />
application-level<br />
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and<br />
low-level software<br />
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of<br />
exascale in many contexts.</p>

<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications (QUESTA) will be hosting a special issue on “Learning and Control in Stochastic Networks” with a submission deadline on March 1, 2021. Details below.</p>
<p>Background and Scope: The theory of stochastic networks and their control is undergoing a phase of exciting collaborative growth with modern machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, fueled by several new applications.</p>
<p>On the one hand, recent years have seen a surge of interest in the application of machine learning techniques to the control of stochastic networks arising in modern communications applications like cloud computing and data centers, the goal being to design agile control mechanisms that operate under minimal informational assumptions and that adapt to changes in system characteristics over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, stochastic networks have emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm for addressing operational questions of matching demand and supply in modern platforms and marketplaces. Examples include ride-sharing platforms, labor platforms, energy markets, etc. A key value proposition of these platforms is the ability to learn from the tremendous amount of transactional data being generated to predict and mitigate supply-demand imbalances, and to recommend and make higher value matches than would otherwise be possible without centralized recommendations and/or matchmaking. Realizing this value proposition requires network control mechanisms that seamlessly assimilate information from data while being robust to strategic concerns.</p>
<p>These developments have led to a growing body of literature on the control of stochastic networks with novel architectures and at the interface of these control mechanisms with machine learning and strategic behavior. The special issue invites papers addressing novel technical challenges in this domain with direct applications to practice.</p>

<p>We invite contributions to a Special Issue on AI for People, to be published by the AI &amp; Society - Journal of Culture, Knowledge and Communication (Springer) <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.">https://www.springer.com/journal/146​.</a></p>
<p>This Special Issue was born out of the idea of shaping Artificial Intelligence technology around human and societal needs. We believe that technology should respect the anthropocentric principle. It should be at the service of the people, not vice-versa. In order to foster this idea, we need to narrow the gap between civil society and technical experts. This gap is one in knowledge, in action and in tools for change.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>SPECIAL ISSUE THEMES</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>The ‘social good’ is something which benefits the general public, being ‘for’ the people, and at the same time, it is something which reflects and respects their wishes, being ‘from’ the people. The ‘social good’ can be envisioned as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals through collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approaches to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned ‘social good’, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development and sustainability.</p>
<p>Nowadays, advances in research on AI systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse about the applicability of the AI Ethics principles when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems. AI Ethical principles are guidelines put forward by policy makers that can act as abstractions, as normative constraints on the do’s and don’ts of algorithmic use in society. Themes of transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy must be taken into account when deploying real-world AI systems.</p>
<p>This Special Issue will focus on the following AI Ethics principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accuracy and Robustness: algorithmic conclusions are probabilities and therefore not infallible and they also might incur in errors during execution. This can lead to unjustified actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Explainability and Transparency: a lack of interpretability and transparency can lead to algorithmic systems that are hard to control, monitor, and correct. This is the commonly called ‘black-box’ issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Bias and Fairness: conclusions can only be as reliable (but also as neutral) as the data they are based on, and this can lead to bias. An action could be found to be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on one group of people.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy: algorithmic activities, like profiling, can lead to challenges for autonomy and informational privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Accountability: it is hard to assign responsibility to algorithmic harms and this can lead to issues with moral responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety and Security: AI systems need to respect and support privacy rights and data protection while ensuring the security of data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of this Special Issue is, however broad, mostly twofold. On one hand, it entails the technical realization of these AI Ethics principles (one or more) in practice. For example, this might refer to specific techniques to ensure principles like ‘fairness’ in an algorithm, with their related practical challenges. On the other hand, it entails addressing these principles from a conceptual standpoint. For example, this might entail, among other things, theorizing, analysing, criticizing and/or further developing the AI principles themselves. Contributions are welcomed from a host of different disciplines, spanning from the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.</p>
<p>=============================</p>

<h1 id="scope">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm</a> FEC</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

<h1 id="scope-1">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

Special Issue on Network management for beyond 5G systems<br />
============================================================================================</p>
<p>Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems are expected to provide a significant increase in data rates, ultra-low latency, enhanced connectivity of a massive number of devices, and improvements in the network energy efficiency. In order to successfully implement and deploy such networks, significant novel contributions and innovations are required in the area of wireless network management.</p>
<p>Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the last 5-10 years have provided a new set of algorithms and tools to solve challenging problems in multiple domains by learning complex relationships directly from data. These kinds of algorithms are also very promising to empower a new generation of fully automated network management mechanisms. However, new challenges emerge, such as deciding when to use traditional management algorithms, AI-based models, or even hybrid approaches; design AI models tailor-made for mobile management problems; decide where they have to be deployed (fog vs. edge); and how to manage their life cycle (from data harvesting to intelligent decision making).</p>
<p>This special issue focuses on novel research in algorithms (especially AI-based) for network management in beyond 5G systems. More specifically, we encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for wireless networks and system management using AI. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardisation status, and new future issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel non-AI-based algorithms for network management in B5G systems with benchmarking against their AI-based counterparts using performance metrics such as solution optimality, algorithm complexity, resource demands, energy consumption, etc.<br />
</li>
<li>AI-based algorithms for network slicing in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>AI-based algorithms for service function chaining and orchestration in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>AI-based algorithms for allocation and management of resources (e.g., spectrum, storage, computing, processing) in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>AI-based algorithms for network state prediction<br />
</li>
<li>Architectures and frameworks for AI-based network and system management in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>Strategies for designing, training, and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>AI-based algorithms for wireless network management in resource-constrained environments<br />
</li>
<li>Guidelines and performance evaluation of AI-based algorithms with objectives and loss functions that are specifically designed for management in B5G systems<br />
</li>
<li>Energy-efficient techniques for data pre-processing, resource allocation, and model training and deployment of AI-based algorithms for management in B5G systems<br />

<p>JCN SPECIAL ISSUE ON</p>
<p>Communications and Networking Approaches for Combatting COVID-19</p>
<p>PUBLICATION DATE: October 2021</p>
<p>Communication and Networking researchers have much to offer to help address the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Wireless networks can be utilized to help facilitate contact tracing and other forms of remote health monitoring. Ideas such as those from coding theory and compressed sensing can be applied to improve group testing algorithms. Epidemic models developed for studying the propagation of information and viruses in communication networks can be adapted to study the propagation of a true epidemic like COVID-19. Techniques such as machine learning can be utilized to make better predictions from limited data. Approaches for privacy and security can be leveraged to protect confidential health information. This special issue seeks original research papers as well as expository and survey papers, addressing such work. Example topics of interest include:</p>
<p>● Modeling and prediction of epidemics over networks</p>
<p>● AI/ML applied to epidemic data</p>
<p>● Approaches for resource constrained testing</p>
<p>● Adaptive interventions</p>
<p>● Contact tracing</p>
<p>● Mobile sensing for health monitoring</p>
<p>● Privacy in E-health</p>
<p>● Technologies to mitigate misinformation around epidemics</p>
<p>● Other communications and networking approaches relevant for combatting COVID-19</p>

<p>Special Issue on</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE AT THE EDGE FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS -</p>
<p>JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING</p>
<p>WEBSITE:<br />
<a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future">https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/call-for-papers/distributed-intelligence-at-the-edge-for-the-future</a></p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</p>
<p>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</p>
<p>These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.</p>

<p>Article Collection “Automatic Performance Management and Optimization on Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters”<br />
Frontiers in Big Data Journal<br />
<a href="https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs">https://fro.ntiers.in/Umfs</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.</p>
<p>As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>The topics of the Article Collection include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />
• Automated resource allocation in heterogeneous clusters<br />
• Workload and task scheduling in heterogeneous environments<br />

<p>journal cover imageThe Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to IoMT. IoMT is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge about fifty years ago, CL has grown and developed exponentially.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-based multimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a new research paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. In particular, this special issue will narrow down to focus on multimedia IoT services in real time systems and there are open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL. Moreover, this SI will explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between CL and IoMT applications including multi-model metadata generation, computational content analysis (text services, audio-visual filtering syntactic and semantic interoperability etc).</p>
<p>By organizing this special issue, we aim at presenting recent and significant developments in the applications of CL with IoMT services.</p>

<p>journal cover imageOver the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from silos built around custom protocol stacks into a system of systems built around standards—and the recent standardization of the Web of Things (WoT) at the IETF and the W3C further facilitates application-layer interoperability in the IoT. Constrained Web servers now target devices with as little as 10 KiB of RAM and 100 KiB of ROM, which means sensors and actuators can be abstracted behind embedded Web services. Going further, the WoT aims to provide uniform access to IoT devices through the Web—by hiding the protocols and interfaces used to access the devices behind abstract interaction patterns and hypermedia controls. From the edge of the network to the cloud, the Web is now emerging as a uniform hypermedia fabric that interconnects IoT devices and digital services.</p>
<p>Still, many research questions remain open. IoT systems are not only inherently complex and heterogeneous, but also highly dynamic as the availability of devices (and their services) changes continually. Moreover, the IoT is inherently decentralized because it is not under the control of a single entity. In such settings, traditional engineering paradigms become impractical. Researchers and practitioners in the IoT community therefore require means to build sophisticated software agents that can achieve their design objectives through flexible interaction with other entities in their system. Many of the underlying research questions the IoT community is now confronted with—such as how to balance goal-directed and reactive behavior in software agents, or how to design and govern interactions in a decentralized IoT—have been investigated in the scientific literature on multiagent systems. At the same time, the IoT unlocks new practical use cases for multiagent systems.</p>
<p>This special issue invites novel research contributions on multiagent systems and services in the IoT/WoT.</p>
