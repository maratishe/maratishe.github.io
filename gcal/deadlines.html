<p>second Call for Papers</p>
<p>Society 5.0 Conference</p>
<p>Integrating Digital World and Real World to Resolve Challenges in Business and Society</p>
<p>Virtual forum - 22nd to 24th June 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/">https://www.conference-society5.org/</a></p>
<p>We are excited to invite you to submit research papers to our first Society 5.0 Conference.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 can be defined as a human-centered society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems by a system that highly integrates cyberspace (virtual space) and physical (real) space. The aim of Society 5.0 is to create a society where social challenges are resolved by incorporating the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution (e.g. Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial intelligence, and the sharing economy) into industry and social life. The term originated in Japan from the government’s Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation and it tackles any aspect of society like healthcare, mobility, infrastructure, politics, government, economy and industry.</p>
<p>Society 5.0 also involves the enormous opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. Problems such as climate change, migration and resource consumption must be solved jointly and globally. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as poverty and education require international efforts. Lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic can have an important impact on dealing with global challenges and crisis situations. Technological advancements and trends for digital transformation should assist us to address these global problems. Convergence of cyberspace and physical space can foster new forms of global cooperation. People, things, and systems are all connected in cyberspace. Results obtained by AI can exceed the capabilities of humans and are fed back to physical space.</p>
<p>The conference Society 5.0 is going to deal with the entire range of these opportunities and challenges and show solutions. For a list of topics please refer to the website <a href="https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers">https://www.conference-society5.org/call-for-papers</a></p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones/special_issues/Swarm</a> FEC</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

<p>Empowering Sustainable Energy Infrastructures via AI-assisted Wireless Communications<br />
IEEE Wireless Communications<br />
<a href="https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy">https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-wireless-communications/cfp/empowering-sustainable-energy</a></p>
<p>Global energy demands will no longer be met using conventional energy infrastructures, and hence can only be achieved through sustainable renewable energy systems that are supported by cyber-physical technologies. The shift from conventional energy sources towards sustainability is clear, leading to the emergence of prosumers (i.e. producers and consumers) which are capable of both generating and consuming energy. Today, many buildings are now equipped with solar panels that can contribute to the overall energy needs. Power systems need to adopt renewable energy to provide more efficient and sustainable operations.</p>
<p>Providing and maintaining sustainable power systems and energy solutions are only achievable through intelligent sensing, monitoring and wireless communications. Today’s advancements in intelligent learning techniques such as deep and reinforcement learning coupled with fast and reliable wireless communications such as 5G, provide great opportunities for new business models for energy providers to improve the way the providers communicate with the grid. Such intelligent learning techniques can for instance determine when and for how long can producers provide and sell power to the grid to maximize their profits and achieve sustainable energy production results. Such learning techniques require fast and reliable wireless communications with different entities in the system. Therefore, the coupling of ultra-fast and reliable wireless communications with intelligent learning will provide sustainable energy solutions for the near future markets.</p>
<p>This special issue considers the adaptation of intelligent learning techniques within wireless networks to enable sustainable power system management. The special issue aims to foster the dissemination of high-quality research with emerging ideas, approaches, theories, frameworks, and practices to tackle the challenging issues related to energy sustainability and power provisioning via the smart grid using wireless networks and intelligent learning methods. Researchers, developers, and industry experts are welcome to contribute to one of the following topics or closely aligned ones:</p>

<p>MDPI Drones - Special Issue</p>
<p>Mobile Fog and Edge Computing in Drone Swarms</p>
<p>Submission Extended Deadline: 15 March 2021</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to push computation and data services toward the edge of the network, closer to the origin of the demand in order to mitigate network load as well as improve service quality by reducing end-to-end latency and overall backhaul bandwidth demand. Potential research directions are fostered for this Special Issue, ranging from security and privacy issues to SwarmFEC deployment, from mobility management to resource optimization, and from joint coordination of aerial vehicles to wireless communications.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication models and protocols for SwarmFEC;<br />
Dynamic fog/edge computing deployment in drone swarms;<br />
Cooperative computing and scheduling strategy in SwarmFEC;<br />
Costs of applications migration and workloads in SwarmFEC;<br />
SwarmFEC support for the Internet of Things (IoT);<br />
Security and privacy in services deployment for SwarmFEC;<br />
Resource allocation and mobility models for energy management in SwarmFEC;<br />
Software-defined networking support for SwarmFEC;<br />
Optimization, learning, and AI to manage application deployment in SwarmFEC;<br />
Spectrum coexistence and optimization for SwarmFEC communications;<br />
SwarmFEC modeling, simulation, emulation, and experimentation.</p>

<p>Applied Energy (Impact Factor 8.848) - Special Issue on “Energy Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Network – Moving towards Real Implementation”</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there has been extensive growth in small-scale distributed energy resources (DER), which encompass behind-the-meter generation, energy storage, inverters, electric vehicles, and controllable loads at the household level. These small-scale resources can be utilized not only to manage the energy demand more efficiently but also to enable a significant mix of clean energy into the grid. However, to do so, it is important for the owners of these assets to actively participate in the energy market. As a consequence, peer-to-peer trading has emerged as a next-generation energy management technique for the smart grid that can enable the owners of small scale DERs - also known as prosumers - to actively participate in the energy market. With the prosumers in control of setting the terms of transactions and the delivery of goods and services, it is expected that the gain that the prosumers can reap from participating in peer-to-peer trading would be substantial. At the same time, the grid — consisting of generators, retailers, and distribution network system providers — can also obtain a significant benefit in terms of reducing peak demand, lowering investment and operational costs, minimizing reserve requirements, and improving power system reliability.</p>
<p>As a result, a large number of studies have been reported on peer-to-peer trading in electricity networks over the past few years. These studies have focused on a number of important decision-making problems of participants in the virtual layer as well as investigated the impacts of peer-to-peer energy trading on the physical distribution network. A large number of pilot projects have also been established in the USA, Europe, and Australia. However, interestingly, there has been no indication of the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the actual energy market in any country. The purpose of this special section is to address this gap by publishing findings from innovative research that have the potential to establish peer-to-peer sharing in today’s electricity market as an energy trading mechanism. The published articles will demonstrate a set of new research outcomes that can successfully decide on energy trading parameters that are beneficial not only for the prosumers but also for other stakeholders within the market. At the same time, transacted energy by prosumers over the physical layer will not detrimentally impact the physical power system network in terms of violating any constraints and increasing the loss significantly.</p>
<p>The targeted audience includes both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The purpose of the special issue is to provide a platform to enhance interdisciplinary research and share the most recent ideas in the above-related fields. In particular, the published article would cover, but not limited to, the following topics of energy system via designing new peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms:</p>
<p>· Electricity market regulation</p>
<p>· Sharing of energy storage</p>
<p>· Providing demand flexibility to the grid</p>

<td>Scope of the Workshop Over the last several decades the Internet has been enriched with novel communication technologies for both fixed and mobile networks providing steadily increasing data rates and lower transfer delays. At the same time, the internet research community has strived to further the development of transport protocols that are able to leverage these new communication technologies, however, this endeavor has been fraught with difficulties, e.g., a widespread use of middleboxes which often drop packets from protocols other than TCP or UDP; an almost universally used socket API that many times unnecessarily limits the communication between the application and transport layers; and, the fact that transport protocols are often part of the operating system kernel, making the introduction of new protocols or protocol features a slow process. In spite of these difficulties, a number of steps have been taken in the past recent years to move the development of internet transport protocols forward: (1) IETF’s Transport Services working group (TAPS) and several industry stakeholders’ efforts to introduce platform- and protocol-independent transport layer APIs, e.g., Apple’s Network.framework, the IETF TAPS API, and the NEAT API; (2) new transport protocols being deployed on the wire that uses UDP as a substrate, e.g., Google’s QUIC protocol, to get around middleboxes; (3) new congestion control mechanisms other than TCP NewReno and Cubic, e.g., Google’s BBR, and finally (4) HTTP/3 that is an effort to port HTTP/2 over QUIC. This has coincided with the introduction of new network technologies such as 5G, and a network softwarization movement using virtualization and containerization techniques, e.g., Software- Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Still, with a seemingly never ending stream of new communication technologies combined with more stringent application requirements, it is not hard to foresee a need for a continued improvement of already deployed transport protocols, as well as research and development of new transport protocols and protocol features e.g., transport protocols for high-capacity, low-latency mobile networks, e.g., transport protocols for V2X, cloud gaming, Industry 4.0, and high-fidelity AR/VR/XR communication; transport-protocol solutions for multipath communication, e.g., 3GPPs ATSSS multipath solution to offload mobile traffic to Wi-Fi; transport protocols that meet the needs of future, more interactive and immersive Web applications, e.g., the development of the QUIC protocol and the BBR congestion-control mechanism; transport protocols, not least userland transport protocols such as QUIC, in virtual environments; SDN and cross-layer transport solutions; new transport layer APIs that meet the need of tomorrow’s internet applications; transport-layer security mechanisms, e.g., to address the conflicting requirements of securing sensitive data while at the same time provide legitimate access to enterprise proxies and firewalls; and, in-network solutions to assist transport protocols in fixed and wireless networks.</td>
