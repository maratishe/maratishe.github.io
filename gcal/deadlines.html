<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>you are invited to consider publication in the MPDI Sensors Special Issue on “Green Sensors Networking”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/green_sens_network</a></p>
<p>Deadline for manuscript submissions: 30 November 2020.</p>
<p>Special Issue Information</p>
<p>Recent improvements in integrated circuit technology have led to the development of new low-cost, tiny sensor nodes. Consequently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being introduced into many different application areas, such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, wearables, transportation, security, surveillance, and other industrial needs. WSNs consist of a large number of self-sustainable, autonomous devices that are able to sense their environment and process and transmit related data. Sensor nodes are commonly hardware-constrained devices that must work under severe resource restrictions such as limited battery, communication, storage, and computing capabilities. In particular, to cope with the scarcity of available energy and to ensure long-term operation, sensor nodes must be designed with low energy radio and sensing units, employ energy efficient communication protocols, and implement optimal energy management policies.<br />
The key for reducing energy consumption in WSNs is the wise utilization of network resources, including power, spectrum, time, and spatial resources. For example, in these networks involving a large number of distributed devices, cooperative power control techniques based on convex optimization or game theory permit governing transmission power efficiently. Furthermore, energy-harvesting technology is frequently used to provide a virtually uninterrupted power supply to the sensor nodes although, due to the intermittent and variable nature of ambient energy sources, accurate prediction schemes of future energy availability may be required to avoid energy shortages.</p>
<p>Energy demands of WSNs can also be reduced, alleviating mutual interference through efficient MAC protocols, employing energy-aware routing algorithms or exploiting available power-saving modes at the sensor nodes. Finally, advanced distributed storage and computation schemes that decrease the number of transmissions and receptions for data collection and dissemination can be adopted to save energy in these networks.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Special Issue is to present the most recent advances, or comprehensive reviews, relating to green wireless sensor networks. Potential topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Energy harvesting;<br />
Distributed power control schemes;<br />
Energy efficient WSN architecture and design;<br />
Energy efficient communication protocols for WSNs;<br />
Green MAC protocols for WSNs;<br />
Green routing algorithms for WSNs;<br />
Green device-to-device communications;<br />
Green computing for sensor nodes;<br />
Energy management policies for sensor nodes;<br />

<p>Smart city is the culmination of applying cutting-edge cyber-physical concepts to city resource management scenarios such as water supply, energy distribution, transportation management and public safety to streamline them for higher operational efficiencies. This is made possible by the tremendous recent advancement in technologies such as cloud computing, computer networking, and Internet of Things. In smart city deployments, sensors and actuators that generate and consume massive volumes of data under diverse formats and ontologies will be integrated into the overall system. The data created by the participating devices need to be appropriately classified and related so that duplication and conflicts can be minimized. To handle the massive volumes of data in a timely manner and to prevent overloads in the cloud infrastructure, newer edge computing paradigms need to be developed.</p>

<p>Motivations<br />
Over the past few years, several theoretical spatiotemporal models have been successively proposed for a better representation of geographical phenomena. From early GIS modelling approaches, a series of extensions have been suggested to integrate time within object-based, field-based and dual representations of geographical data, while a series of formal qualitative approaches have also contributed to more fundamental frameworks that support advanced spatial reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, many successful environmental and urban GIS research studies have demonstrated that the temporal dimension can be implicitly integrated by different representation and analytical frameworks. This Special Issue is calling for innovative works that integrate the spatial and temporal dimensions within theoretical, formal and practical GIS solutions as well as urban and environmental applications that demonstrate a sound integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>
<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Formal spatiotemporal reasoning;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal ontologies and standards;</p></li>
<li><p>Spatiotemporal modelling approaches;</p></li>

<td>In the last few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones), have been rapidly developed due to device miniaturization and cost reduction. These Aerial cooperative systems can provide fast, cost-effective, and safe solutions for many civil and military applications. Drone swarms, made of highly mobile self-organizing vehicles, are characterized by the coordination and mobility of nodes that can accomplish distributed sensing and actuation tasks. However, these applications may require reliable communication as well as intensive computation leading to high energy consumption. Unfortunately, UAVs are in general battery-powered and are equipped with devices that are not capable of providing a fast and reliable reply to user applications. In this respect, mobile fog and edge computing applied to drone swarm (SwarmFEC) draws an adaptive and agile approach by enabling cross-domain control and management protocols to be deployed, thus revolutionizing the way swarm computation is executed.</td>

<p>Special Issue on Mobile and Edge Computing Systems<br />
The ubiquitous deployment of mobile computing platforms and embedded Internet of Things devices have catalyzed the development of various computing services deeply embedded to our everyday lives. Recently with relatively more powerful edge platforms, computationally heavy tasks that could not be previously enabled using resource limited mobile and embedded platforms can be realized to enable a richer set of localized services. The combination of mobile and edge computing systems has enabled the use of tasks such as various deep learning techniques and computationally heavy blockchains to mobile and embedded computing scenarios, but have also introduced new challenges related to utilizing the limited resources, maintaining user privacy and preserving energy efficiency.<br />
The objective of this special issue is to explore recent advances in mobile and edge computing systems to address practical and fundamental challenges. Networking, security, and AI-based schemes to support mobile and edge computing systems as well as application designs are all potential topics that can collectively tackle such challenges. Specifically, potential topics include but are not limited to the following:<br />
● Intelligent deployment of mobile and edge computing systems<br />
● Deep learning technologies for mobile and edge computing<br />
● Novel communication and network paradigms for mobile and edge computing<br />
● Latency and energy-aware computing<br />

<p>Special Issue on Novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data Methods and Findings for COVID-19</p>
<p>Brief description/Scope</p>
<p>COVID-19 has become the most significant challenge the human beings have encountered since World War 2 (WW2). It is reported to have more deaths in the US than the combination of the Pearl Harbor War and the September 11 terror attacks. COVID-19 itself is highly infectious and speed in which it can mutate is rapid and in different varieties, with reported six strands of active coronaviruses widely spread worldwide. It has infected more than 17 million of the population worldwide in late July 2020. In early March 2020, the total infected cases were still not reaching 100,000 (WHO, 2020). This global challenge is causing rapidly increased numbers of infected cases, death, and the way we live, such as social distancing. This has caused a lack of medical resources and healthcare crisis to fight against the infection before the development of vaccines and drugs. Other economic and social problems are common, such as job loss, insecurity, lack of movements, increases in crimes, improvements in fighting limited resources and has been seen (Ecke, 2020). In addition to this, the computing services for the identification and development of drugs are also challenging. In such cases, the quality and the quantity of the collected data plays a major role which uses cloud computing architectures (Chang, 2014; Sicari et al., 2016; Hosseinian-Far et al., 2018). The technology of the Internet of Things combined with Artificial Intelligence techniques may provide good solutions to this health-oriented problem (Vaishya et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Solutions for those urgent needs are required globally to understand how to tackle this challenge. Scientists have a crucial role, not only in research and development, but also provide positive impacts to the society. In terms of Machine Learning, AI and Big Data research, scientists can offer recommendations, new discoveries and pioneering methods (Gupta et al. 2018), which may provide positive impacts and findings to the causes, cure and analysis of treatment. The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and used widely for confirmation of infection (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, secure transmission of messages among medical professionals is also a challenging task during COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent treatment (Wang et al., 2020). It has already been widely recognized that novel Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods can potentially have significant substantial roles in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offering high-quality research outputs and accurate predictive modeling (Oksavik et al., 2020; Tuli et al., 2020). Therefore, this requires novel methods such as blended LSTM, hybrid reinforcement learning, advanced deep learning, modern artificial intelligence and computational data intelligence since they are crucial for research findings. Together with pioneering methods, innovative Machine Learning, AI and Big Data for COVID-19 can provide added values for scientists. In this special issue, we seek unpublished and high quality work based on unique Machine Learning, AI and Big Data methods and findings. Best paper winners and top authors from IIoTBDSC 2020 will also be invited.</p>

<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>Intelligent transportation systems play an important role in the sustainable<br />
development of the world economy. In the era of autonomous driving,<br />
intelligent transportation systems will see disruptive transformation and<br />
enable smart mobility. However, their success heavily depends on the<br />
construction of dynamic maps, which further relies on precision positioning<br />
of both moving and static objects, on the road (2-D positioning) or in the<br />
sky (3-D positioning). GNSS is the primary signal source for localization.<br />
Ground signals such as radio (UWB, radar) and light (LiDAR, camera), provide<br />
alternative positioning means where GNSS alone is not sufficient or not<br />
available to provide high-precision positions. In addition, the forthcoming<br />
5G brings more possibilities of precision positioning by exploiting the<br />
massive MIMO technique.</p>
<p>This Special Issue aims to highlight advances in all aspects of<br />
high-precision positioning in intelligent transportation systems for<br />
different objects, including land vehicles, pedestrians, unmanned aerial<br />
vehicles (UAVs), underwater vehicles, considering GNSS signals, ground<br />
signals, and their combinations. Up-to-date reviews and original works are<br />
both accepted in this issue. Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-GNSS receivers and emerging navigation satellite<br />
systems;</p></li>
<li><p>Design, prototyping, and testing of positioning devices;</p></li>
<li><p>Detection and mitigation techniques for adverse propagation<br />
conditions;</p></li>
<li><p>5G Positioning;</p></li>
<li><p>Multisensor fusion;</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperative localization;</p></li>
<li><p>LiDAR Odometry;</p></li>

<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing, especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness), but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations, strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move among different coverage areas in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce). Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years, especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

<p>********** Call for Papers **********</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>GNSS solutions are now part of our everyday life. Most of the uses are linked to transport applications, and most often in urban areas, where availability and accuracy are degraded due to signal obstructions, multipath, and NLOS (Non Line Of Sight) reception. Solutions are embedded in cars, autonomous vehicles or fleets of vehicles; drones; public transport systems (buses, trams); as well as smartphone-based solutions.<br />
New and future uses of localization solutions will, however, require a high level of performance in terms of availability and accuracy but also integrity.<br />
To reach high-level performances, new solutions have to be developed. They can rely on the potential of precise positioning, including RTK and PPP that has to be investigated. Special attention has to be paid to algorithms covering GNSS local effect detection, characterization, exclusion or mitigation techniques. Multisensor or hybrid solutions aim to compensate for the degradation of the GNSS. Among new algorithms, one can mention context detection approaches; multiagent collaboration; or uses of environment knowledge based on 3D models, map-matching, or other external sensors such as Camera or LiDAR.<br />
New integrity concepts have to consider these new algorithms and the local errors to properly bound the residual errors.<br />
Lastly, another important issue is also the development of methodologies and tools that are capable of evaluating performances in such areas.<br />
