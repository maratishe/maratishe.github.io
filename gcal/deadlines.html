<p>The conference will focus on the application of IT technologies to<br />
social good. Social good is typically defined as an action that provides<br />
some sort of benefit to the general public. In this case, Internet<br />
connection, education, and healthcare are all good examples of social<br />
goods. However, new media innovations and the explosion of online<br />
communities have added new meaning to the term. Social good is now about<br />
global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals,<br />
technology, and collaboration to create positive societal impact.</p>

<p>IEEE Global Communications Conference<br />
7-11 December 2021<br />
Madrid, Spain</p>
<p>Selected Areas in Communication Symposium: Social Networks Track</p>
<p>SCOPE AND MOTIVATION<br />
Recently, social network research has advanced rapidly with the prevalence of online social applications and mobile social communications systems. Moreover, the ongoing pandemic via contact social networks has caused tremendous human life and economic loss around the world, and infodemic is one of the major social impacts that make people difficult to discriminate trustworthy sources, from false and manipulative information sources. Therefore, researchers are increasingly interested in addressing a wide spectrum of challenges in social networks, such as developing social-aware algorithms for communications systems, identifying the topological common structures and information/influence flows, analyzing the social media and evolutions of social graphs, and exploiting location-based and contextual information embedded in mobile social networks to create innovative applications. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, social networks have also attracted intensive research interests across multiple disciplines, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, big data analytics, information security and privacy protection, psychology, and marketing. In light of the above crucial needs, Selected Areas in Communication Symposium in Social Networks will serve as a forum for researchers and technologists to discuss the state-of-the-art, present their contributions, and set future directions in social networks.</p>

<p>SCOPE:<br />
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</p>
<p>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</p>
<p>These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.</p>

<p>Submission due: May 31, 2021</p>
<p>High performance computing (HPC) offers the computing power to<br />
continuously support<br />
the world’s most important discoveries in various scientific and<br />
business domains such<br />
as chemistry, physics, biology, material science, drug discovery and<br />
financial<br />
investment risk analysis. The exascale computing era is soon coming. A<br />
number of<br />
exaflops-capable supercomputers are scheduled to be fully operational in<br />
the time<br />
frame of 2021 and 2022. Researchers from across the HPC community are<br />
developing<br />
software systems, tools, libraries, frameworks, application packages,<br />
and methods that<br />
can fully exploit these extremely powerful computing resources.</p>
<p>Extreme-scale computing will enable the solution of vastly more accurate<br />
predictive<br />
models and the analysis of massive quantities of data, producing quantum<br />
advances in<br />
areas of science and technology that are essential to the scientific<br />
community. New<br />
computational approaches such as machine learning/deep learning have<br />
also been<br />
heavily explored in recent years and shown promising evidence for many<br />
problems that<br />
cannot be resolved by traditional computational simulation and<br />
engineering. Training<br />
deep neural networks with massive data is an extremely computing<br />
intensive task that<br />
heavily relies on the HPC power. The upcoming exascale computing era<br />
will be the<br />
essential basis for supporting new innovations in machine learning/deep<br />
learning based<br />
exploration and lead to new sciences in directions such as smart<br />
manufacturing,<br />
laboratory-automation, and automatic programming.</p>
<p>While the hardware architecture can generate extreme computing power,<br />
renovation in<br />
software stack plays the essential role for effective performance<br />
delivery. The exascale<br />
and pre-exascale systems such as Aurora, Frontier, El Capitan and LUMI<br />
continue to<br />
move into the heterogeneous space, while the current fastest ARM-based<br />
system,<br />
Fugaku and the many core Sunway Taihulight type of systems are marching<br />
towards<br />
the heterogeneous space. With systems equipped with GPUs, ARM SVEs and many<br />
cores, there is a dire need for innovative software frameworks that can<br />
seamlessly<br />
migrate scientific code to these systems equipped with rich compute<br />
resources. We<br />
need innovation at different levels including compiler tools and<br />
techniques, performance<br />
analysis tools, novel abstractions at the programming model, redesign of<br />
application-level<br />
algorithms and so on. Furthermore, co-design of applications and<br />
low-level software<br />
frameworks can lead to more efficient use of the opportunities of<br />
exascale in many contexts.</p>

IEEE Security &amp; Privacy<br />
=======================</p>
<p>Call for Papers: Special Issue on Security and Privacy Issues of Home<br />
Globalization</p>
<p>In recent years, people have been reshaping their homes into smart homes<br />
by using a wide array of home-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices,<br />
including inter-connected lights, locks, sensors, actuators, wearables,<br />
and appliances accessible through the Internet and controlled locally<br />
(e.g., via voice) or remotely (e.g., via mobile phone). These smart home<br />
devices are complemented by laptops, mobile phones, game consoles,<br />
electronical health equipment, and many other consumer IoT nodes, which<br />
are constantly used at home for work, pleasure, health, and<br />
entertainment, just to mention the most common purposes. The emerging<br />
pervasiveness of IoT technologies is transforming homes into globalized<br />
homes in which devices supporting everyday activities can be accessed<br />
from anywhere. Although home globalization has its benefits, it also<br />
covertly renders homes more insecure and less private places where<br />
individuals are exposed to more and more varying threats from the<br />
outside world.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits, home globalization and the used technologies have<br />
led to many security threats and privacy breaches. In fact, home-based<br />
IoT technologies at the basis of globalized homes are becoming prone to<br />
abuses including adaptations of well-known cyber-attacks leveraging the<br />
variety of data and devices populating modern apartments and houses. In<br />
addition, both home-based and consumer IoT frameworks collect and manage<br />
information that is tightly coupled with the everyday life of<br />
individuals and can thus be considered a source of sensitive data that<br />
is of interest for profiling or reconnaissance attempts. Therefore, the<br />
resulting home globalization requires us to face new threats and risks<br />
leading to different challenges. In fact, modern homes are<br />
technologically balkanized with services provided via different<br />
technologies (IEEE 802.15.4, home/consumer IoT, voice-based assistants)<br />
and by multiple vendors (device and software) often by using a cloud- or<br />
fog-based scheme. Additional challenges stem from the relatively covert<br />
introduction of new risks during home globalization, as people tend to<br />
put more focus on functionalities of new smart devices than the security<br />
and privacy implications of their use. In this perspective, enforcing<br />
security and privacy in such a scenario requires rethinking and<br />
developing new defenses and solutions, as well as addressing new social<br />
challenges for law enforcement agencies, policy makers, and forensics<br />
professionals.</p>
<p>This special issue aims at collecting the most relevant ongoing research<br />
efforts in the security and privacy field concerning home globalization.<br />
Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security management of home-based and consumer IoT<br />
</li>
<li>Network security of globalized homes<br />
</li>
<li>Adoption of cybersecurity measures in globalized homes, including<br />
child safety<br />
</li>
<li>Surveillance, interception, blocking, and sovereignty in home-based<br />
IoT environments<br />
</li>
<li>De-anonymization, AI-based social inference, integrity, and privacy leaks<br />
</li>
<li>Stealth communication, information hiding threats, and their detection<br />
in home-based IoT environments<br />
</li>
<li>Cybercrime investigation, law, jurisdiction, and ethics in home-based<br />
IoT environments</li>
</ul>

<p>SCOPE:<br />
Currently and even more in the future, business, industry, finance and retail, healthcare, media, entertainment and many others, are and will be completely managed, coordinated, and controlled using huge amounts of data. These operations are performed by the Internet of Things (IoT) system of connected computing, digital, and mechanical devices, all of them named using unique identifiers (UIDs) and able to transfer data over a network without human intervention.</p>
<p>To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is still utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to the increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is limited network connectivity. Therefore, the adoption of cloud computing to process data generated by IoT devices may not be applicable at all to classes of applications such as those needed for real-time, low latency, and mobile applications. Therefore, it is beyond imagination to use cloud computing to collect data, store, and work out results. Therefore, there has been a move towards mobile communication and edge computing. Billions of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. The problem remains on how to extract information from collected data best.</p>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural network, and data analytic techniques in edge processing resulted in a new inter-disciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as distributed edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI and distributed edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become smarter and smarter. There is also a need of the presentation of the most recent outcome of research of distributed intelligence. This need could be illustrated by a smart city that contains for instance: garages, parkings, car washing systems, traffic unloading centrals etc. – usually belonging to different companies and running different protocols. A most likely scenario is that these devices could use different AI systems to support their activities. However, all of them are parts of one interconnected smart city; different AI systems must cooperate for common goal(s). Thus, we need distributed intelligence. Examples and different AI systems working for different edges could be multiplied; they support a variety of edges. All want to make money, kick competitors from the market out, and grab their systems. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on creating better software and algorithms that can run efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Moreover, purpose-built hardware at the edge is becoming increasingly important in the field of machine learning because companies can run software much more efficiently if they use specialized chips. Another key challenge of distributed edge AI will be the continued improvement of user interfaces that are used to communicate with other humans, including text, voice, vision, and different forms of body language.</p>
<p>These only are some of the challenges of edge intelligence. This field is expected to arise in the upcoming years and become an essential part of the next generation of the Internet of Things that expands its reach into almost every domain. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to identify and provide high-quality research on recent advances on edge AI and distributed edge AI. We are interested in all aspects pertaining to this multidisciplinary paradigm.</p>

<p>As Guest Editors, we cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue “Cloud-Based IoT Applications for Smart Cities” to be published in the journal Smart Cities (ISSN 2624-6511) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities/).</p>
<p>The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement.<br />
Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy.<br />
The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT.<br />

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The vision of a Future Internet has steered many research works. Fifth-generation (5G) networks built across the globe are considered a driving force for the Future Internet. Network softwarization strategies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are set to bring more unified control and flexibility to classic network architectures. Software-defined systems have been built to enlarge the scope of the network softwarization efforts up to the Internet scale. Services computing enables the decoupling of complex workflows. The Internet of the future is a computer, where users will say what to do, and the network will do it. The computation is brought closer to the end-users’ computers in-network at the edge. We envision the future Internet to be more accessible and high-performing across the world, with new governance models and collective intelligence. Combined and made more flexible, resorting to containerization, services computing can scale to the Internet, composing dynamic workflows with minimal data transfer and low latency.</p>
<p>We invite researchers to contribute to this Special Issue with their original research works or survey papers that focus on the challenges and solutions towards realizing the Future Internet.</p>

<p>THEME</p>
<p>Globalization, urbanization and digitalization are rapidly changing established structures and appearances of cities and regions across the world. In particular, tomorrow’s societies face new challenges in rural and remote regions, characterized by low population densities, low potential revenues, and large distances to urban clusters and to societal service. How is economic development in these regions assured? How are democratic values and governing structures guaranteed? How will governments be able to ascertain that residents and visitors of such regions will remain a part of an inclusive society? It is widely recognized that provision of reliable fixed and mobile broadband connectivity is an important part of the answer. Ubiquitous broadband connectivity has been linked to many of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>The fifth cellular network generation has started to be rolled out these days, starting in the cities. For over three decades, new technologies and innovations have first reached urban regions where return-on-investment has been high, after which deployments and coverage have successively moved outwards to the countryside, rurality and regions with less operational revenues. This process has consistently generated wealth and value in urban regions first, and hence increased the urban-rural gap.</p>
<p>Provision of reliable, ubiquitous connectivity with sustainable performance in remote areas is a challenge that remains unconquered despite successive generations of standards and networks. Service and equipment providers who grapple with unsustainable ARPUs, and end users who are perpetually denied the fruits of advancements in communications technology. Establishing broadband connectivity in remote and low-ARPU regions requires overcoming new and different research and engineering challenges that are not as pertinent in other topographies and demographics.</p>
<p>The goal of this Research Topic is to collect and publish original research articles that contribute to bridging these divides with future networks. Timing is opportune, given that work in the area of 6G is gaining traction and early emphasis to this area can bolster the chances of it getting a fair representation. We envisage this Research Topic as a collection of timely and relevant research results that advance today’s knowledge and understanding in topics related to wireless broadband access for rural and remote areas and, moreover, provide credible new insights with a good potential to impact rural societies and low-ARPU regimes everywhere.</p>
<p>Submissions may span various domains of research and may focus on various critical rural-network aspects, from radio architectural and access concepts and technologies, through spectrum regulatory policies and processes, to business models and new network-operational approaches. We welcome articles (original research and survey articles, but also magazine-style articles) in both technological and techno-economical domains, analyses that increase understanding for the mechanisms of the urban-rural divide, the ARPU divide, as well as new approaches, concepts and solutions that help bridging these. Industry views and contributions are particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>• Channel and propagation modeling for rural and remote regions</p>
<p>• Physical layer design: coding, modulation, waveform, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming</p>
<p>• Medium access control frameworks for rural scenarios</p>
<p>• Networking and backhauling for rural and remote areas</p>
<p>• Multi-hop network elasticity</p>
<p>• Physical-layer solutions for front/mid/backhaul.</p>
<p>• Delay-tolerant networks, traffic models, edge caching, etc</p>
<p>• Non-terrestrial network solutions</p>
<p>• Quality-of-Experience in rural and remote regions</p>
<p>• SDN and SON with respect to rural/remote networks and connectivity</p>
<p>• Network layout planning and maintenance, status sensing/diagnosing and performance optimization</p>
<p>• Incorporating context, using cognition and applying AI/ML tools</p>
<p>• Energy harvesting, energy efficiency and green solutions</p>
<p>• Coexistence and convergence with 5G NR and legacy systems</p>
<p>• Spectrum management, standardization, policies and regulatory issues</p>
<p>• Business models for beyond-5G deployments in rural and remote areas</p>
<p>• Radio or traffic measurement campaigns in rural scenarios</p>
<p>• Impact of novel technical solutions on OPEX and CAPEX for rural area scenarios</p>

<p>Special Issue on Federated Deep Learning-Empowered Internet of Vehicles</p>
<p>Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is designed to seamlessly connect smart vehicles, road infrastructures, communication facilities and users. The goal is to provide a comprehensive environment overview, improve transportation efficiency and reduce road accidents. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning, is essential for the progress of intelligent IoV. However, with the growing complexity of on-board sensors, the big raw data sets available for deep learning can give rise to concerns over data security and privacy, as well as huge communication overheads.</p>
<p>Distributed machine learning among smart vehicles and edge-cloud entities based on federated deep learning (FDL) is helping to address these challenges. FDL allows a central server to cooperate with multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model. Clients upload parameters of the trained model to the central server and keep their training data locally, thus significantly reducing the communication costs and the data privacy risks. Although FDL has great potential for intelligent IoV, further research is required in some areas. For example, the trade-off optimisation between Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption in intelligent IoV, the efficient design of learning models in FDL for different intelligent IoV problems, communication efficiency for heterogeneous IoV technologies, and the security and privacy issues related to FDL under the dynamic IoV environment.</p>
<p>The objective of this special issue is to assemble high-quality research papers on emerging theories, frameworks, architectures and algorithms for solving the challenging problems related to FDL- empowered intelligent IoV. It will also offer an open platform for scholars and engineers to exchange their recent novel ideas and explore the potential convergence of existing intelligent IoV systems and advanced FDL technologies.</p>
<p>Topics Covered:</p>
<p>Novel FDL algorithms for intelligent IoV systems and applications<br />
Architectures and models for FDL-empowered IoV<br />
Theory and protocols for FDL-empowered IoV<br />
Resource management for FDL-empowered IoV<br />

<td>Dear Colleagues, As Guest Editor, I cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue “Security Measures in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks” to be published in the journal Electronics (IF 2.412) (ISSN 2079-9292) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/).</td>

<td>The Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is a self-organised ad-hoc network that can be formed by connecting vehicles with other vehicles on the road and with static infrastructure such as crossroads or parking lots. VANET allows its users to share their information and knowledge about road conditions, events, and traffic. Analysing data from this type of network allows road safety to be increased efficiently by controlling crises on the road and supports traffic management thanks to Internet access for drivers and software developers. However, just like any network, VANET is exposed to attacks and attempts to gain access to data that are generated and transferred between network elements. Therefore, it has become necessary to design, develop, and extend the appropriate security methods, mechanisms and tools for VANET to protect and secure data exchanged between the network nodes, and, consequently, to secure its users and protect them against incorrect information, misinformation, and delays in information sending. This Special Issue aims to present a collection of papers that address problems in the methods, mechanisms, and tools for securing the VANETs and their users by exploring aspects such as security design, architectures, deployment, routing, and protocols. Topics of interest include but not are limited to security methods and mechanics for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication environments, protective methods against any form of security attack (e.g., DoS attack, timing attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Bogus, Sybil, Black, Worm and Gray Hole attack), the security of routing protocols, security and privacy methods for availability, confidentiality, data integration, authentication, and access control.</td>

<td>Description In recent years, supervised machine learning methods (e.g. k nearest neighbours, Bayes’ theorem, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network, gated recurrent unit network), unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g. association rules, k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, hierarchical clustering, deep belief networks, deep Boltzmann machine, auto-encoder, de-noising auto-encoder, etc.), reinforcement learning methods (e.g. generative adversarial network, deep Q network, trust region policy optimization, etc.), and federated learning methods have been applied to security and communication networks. For instance, machine learning methods have been used to analyze the behaviours of the data stream in networks and extract the patterns of malicious activities (packet dropping, worm propagation, jammer attacks, etc.) for generating rules in intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, time-series methods (e.g. local outlier factor, cumulative sum, adaptive online thresholding, etc.) have been proposed to retrieve the time-series features of anomalous behaviours for preventing cyber-attacks and malfunctions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>While the area of machine learning methods for security and communication networks is a rapidly expanding field of scientific research, several open research questions still need to be discussed and studied. For instance, using and improving machine learning methods for malicious activity detection, attack detection, mobile endpoint analyses, repetitive security task automation, zero-day vulnerability prevention, and other security applications are important issues in computing and communications.</td>

<td>CALL FOR PAPERS Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and non-functional practices. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the Internet by 2023.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business, information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis, knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) trend.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Topics of Interest This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT. Topics for discussions include, but are not limited to: • Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0. • Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture • Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture. • Context management and awareness for IoT-based enterprise architecture • Case studies related to IoT-based enterprise architecture.</td>

<td>Edge Computing is emerging due to the great availability of computational resources, mobile devices, sensors and actuators that are pervasively deployed and today amount to more than 7 billion interfaces with the network. It enables the pushing of computation to the edge of the network, away from data centers and close to people and data sources. Edge Intelligence derives from the convergence of Edge Computing with the smart exploitation of artificial intelligence methodologies and cognitive technologies, involving sensing/actuation, learning and reasoning on distributed data and Internet of Things devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>A new generation of smart environments, empowered with Edge Intelligence capabilities, can assist the effective management of a modern society, by combining the development of advanced services able to satisfy user needs and preferences dynamically, with undelayable aspects like better exploitation of renewable energy sources, energy optimization, environment sustainability, people’s safety, quality of life and comfort. Edge Intelligence helps service provisioning, computation and communications to become efficient, green and sustainable in different ways, among which: (i) Edge Intelligence can contribute to optimize data center usage and reduce the amount of data needing to traverse the network, leading to a reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions; (ii) applications enriched by Edge Intelligence can satisfy user needs through a more sustainable use of environmental resources; (iii) based on predictions performed by Edge Intelligence algorithms, data and computation can be brought closer to the sites where green energy is available.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Edge Intelligence offers an unprecedented opportunity to offer cutting edge services to individuals and organizations and, at the same time, to contrast the continuous growth in the exchange of data and use of communication and network infrastructures. The energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions related to ICT technologies are estimated to amount, respectively, to 3% and 4% of the total, and these figures are being further increased by the Covid 19 pandemic. This Special Issue aims to be a valuable venue for novel and original research works in the field of Edge Intelligence and its exploitation for the design and development of sustainable and smart environments like smart cities and cognitive buildings.</td>

<td>The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).</td>

<p>Online Social Networks and Media are a fundamental component of the cyber-physical convergences, representing one of the main bridges between the human behaviour across the physical and virtual worlds. Therefore, the “trails” users leave behind while using OSNEM can be mined, via big data analytics and AI, to characterize individual and social human behaviours at an unprecedented scale. Moreover, the speed at which events can be detected via OSNEM data analysis makes OSNEM a prime way to monitor the evolution of human behaviours and nowcast their development and consequences in both the physical and virtual worlds. For example, OSNEM can be used to shed light, through big data analysis, on the diffusion of COVID-19 in the real world.</p>
<p>This special issue seeks contributions pushing the state of the art in all facets of the use of OSNEM as big data microscopes to investigate complex human individual and social behaviours. We solicit manuscripts presenting quantitative analysis and modelling based on BigData collected from OSNEM.</p>
<p>Within this framework, topics include, but are not limited to:<br />
- Analysis of social structures via OSNEM<br />
- Analysis and modelling of information and opinion dynamics in OSNEM<br />
- Early detection of critical phenomena in the cyber and physical worlds<br />
- Prediction of (near-)future events based on OSNEM data analysis<br />
- OSNEM monitoring and analysis for the protection of users and critical infrastructures<br />
- Mobility characterization and modelling<br />
- Characterisation of users’ behaviour in smart cities<br />
- OSNEM data-driven approaches to study COVID-19 related phenomena<br />
- Pandemic tracking and control via OSNEM big data analysis<br />
- Models of individual and social behaviour through OSNEM big data during the pandemic<br />
- OSNEM users’ characterization for mass customization of products and services<br />
- Analysis of large social phenomena (e.g., political movements) via OSNEM big data<br />
- Privacy-preserving big data analytics for human behaviour characterisation<br />
- Efficient methodologies for large-scale OSNEM data collection and analysis</p>
<p>Online Social Networks and Media is a multidisciplinary journal for the wide community of computer and network scientists working on developing OSNEM platforms and services and using OSNEM as a big data source to mine, learn and model the (online) human behaviour.<br />
Manuscripts only based on questionnaires, even focused on the reported use of social media, are outside the scope of the journal. On the other hand, the journal welcomes papers which present analyses based on big data mined from social networks/media.</p>

<p>Special Issue on “Special Issue on Edge Computing Optimization Using Artificial Intelligence Methods”</p>
<p>MDPI IoT Journal</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The growing importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous high capacity provided by 5G technologies have brought the specter of massive quantities of data being generated and/or consumed by sensors, actuators, and smart devices. Such massive amounts of data require considerable processing power, which is available in the cloud. However, cloud-based computation and data delivery models do not allow the stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be efficiently harnessed. The latter is due to the number of hops of wired networks between the data endpoints and the cloud, which leads to a significant increase in latency, which may dramatically affect real-time control and other critical systems. Moreover, forwarding all the data generated by such devices directly to the cloud may devour the network bandwidth, leading to congestion. Therefore, it is necessary that critical processing to be hosted closer to the endpoint devices, i.e., closer to the sources and sinks of the data so that data can be processed and filtered out by the time it reaches the cloud. This can be achieved through Edge Computing (EC).</p>
<p>Efficient, scalable, and QoS-aware placement of IoT data processing jobs in EC resources is a complex optimization problem and, currently, an active research topic. As new jobs are created, they have to be assigned computational resources dynamically, matching job requirements with the cost, reliability, location (and mobility), besides the current availability of the resources. Less critical or demanding communication jobs may be offloaded to the cloud. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to jointly tackle the problem of job placement optimization, including jobs belonging to AI-based data analytics software, constitute currently active research topics addressed by this Special Issue.</p>
<p>For this Special Issue, original scientific articles are welcome on the following as well as closely related topics:<br />
- AI-based algorithms to optimize job placement in EC<br />
- AI software architectures favoring distributed computing job placement in EC resources (e.g., Distributed Deep Neural Network architectures)<br />
- AI-based mechanisms supporting open EC markets leveraging the participation of third-party computing resources opportunistically (e.g., parked autonomous vehicles)<br />

<p>s Guest Editors, we cordially invite you to submit a manuscript for consideration and possible publication in a Special Issue “Cloud-Based IoT Applications for Smart Cities” to be published in the journal Smart Cities (ISSN 2624-6511) (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities/).</p>
<p>The idea of the smart city connects many IT systems that improve and automate various aspects of everyday life. The effect of implementing the smart city idea is the popularization of access to information about the city, plans for further development, improving the work of offices and municipal institutions, better investment conditions, improved communication, improving the functioning of municipal services, improving the conditions of the environment, increasing safety, increasing the number of cultural and sports activities and opportunities to spend free time, as well as the active participation of residents in development and improvement.<br />
Thanks to Internet of Things devices, it is possible to automate tedious processes related to measurement and data transfer, and it is also possible to control the mechanisms remotely. In a smart city, there are many different types of sensors that collect information about the environment and send it to the central office. The question is: What to do with such a huge amount of data? Where to store it and how to manage it effectively? This is where cloud computing comes in handy.<br />
The main goal of this Special Issue is to analyze the possibilities that arise from the use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in the idea of the smart city, both for technical and utility reasons, as well as for the development of ICT.<br />
The manuscript submission deadline is 31 January 2022. We will process your paper in time once we receive your submission. For more details please visit the Special Issue website:</p>

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing Special Issue on “AI Drives Our Future Life”</p>
<hr />
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>While “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) becomes the mainstream of application techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented. AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications, self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI, such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both academic and industrial communities. Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g., cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).</p>
<p>Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation, realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the performance and energy efficiency for various computation and memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI for</p>
<p>various domains to share new findings among the community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.</p>

<p>About the Conference</p>
<p>Future mobile networks will evolve out of existing wired and wireless networks of different nature by means of convergence, fusion and mutual penetration; next-generation multimedia services in turn pose new requirements and challenges on treatment of traffic within communication systems - a certain degree of multilayer co-operation has to be achieved. This forms a framework on harmonization of results obtained separately in different areas of network research like network performance evaluation, architecture and protocol design, and low layer network design. The conference goal is in the identification, investigation and integration of new algorithms, approaches, architectures, methods and mechanisms to enable proper and efficient operation of a next-generation IP-based wireless network. Therefore, wireless networks and systems and their interaction with wired networks and systems shall be widely examined and addressed throughout the conference.</p>
<p>The history of NEW2AN dates back to 1993, today it is an established conference featured by proceedings published by Springer LNCS (confirmed) and distinguished keynote speakers.</p>
<p>The NEW2AN 2021 will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia - the meeting point of East and West. Through its stunning architecture and wonderful art galleries and museums, among a number of other attractions, the wealth of history of East and West can be seen and felt in this beautiful city.</p>

<td>Rapid urbanization and social change drives governments to seek out new ways to deliver services and manage cities and drives innovation in processes and policies through smart cities. At the same time, emerging digital technologies offer new ways for local government to understand and monitor the dynamics of the city, respond to the state of the city, carry out administrative tasks and streamline procedures. The complexity of smart cities and settlements means that roles and responsibilities must shift to allow a greater range of stakeholders to contribute to the design and delivery of smart services. This means that smart cities need to find new ways to interact with business, thought-leaders, suppliers, residents, and visitors. Greater transparency and frequent, two-way communication are expected with the co-creation of public services allowing for greater innovation. Advances in data science allow relevant, real-time data to be transformed into useful information to understand urban behavior and infrastructure needs. This can support evidence-based decision making, automated responses and autonomously managed procedures. Realizing this potential, however, raises concerns about privacy and security issues, the resilience of critical information infrastructures, and the unintended consequences as social expectations and behaviors are shaped by algorithms.</td>

<td>The Internet, and more generally networks, are today almost mandatory in each application context. They are one of the most important key enablers for applications to be considered as smart, like those used in smart agriculture or smart industry. Since the number of users and connected devices in networks keep growing, more computational and consequently more energy resources are required. This has a big impact on the environment, specifically in pollution driven by electronical components and by the carbon footprint. Over many decades, researchers have started to tackle that problem and to propose sustainable solutions like recycling and exploiting renewable energies. Still, challenges are growing as technologies, infrastructures, architectures, and applications are always evolving, requiring more and more energy. It is worth noticing that the issue is not only a matter of reducing energy consumption but also of more efficiently managing available resources and specifically energy. The smart grid, with new services like storage, can be a key enabler to efficiently manage the energy demand for networks.</td>

Pervasive computing has not only been a vivid research area, but also found its way into many commercial and consumer systems and applications due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor and actuator systems, ambient intelligence, and smart mobile and embedded devices. Due to the pervasiveness of such systems, users become central in the development and realization of innovative pervasive systems.

Workshops should be organized to promote lively interaction, and plans to promote interaction and discussion must be clearly addressed in the written workshop proposals. The organizers of accepted workshops are required to publicize the workshop through disseminating the call for papers, solicit submissions, conduct the reviewing process, and decide upon the final workshop program. At least one organizer must be physically present at the workshop. We are aware that the possibility to visit Pisa depends on the future pandemic situation and of course only applies under the assumption that PerCom can take place as a hybrid event (at least partially in presence).

<p>Description<br />
In recent years, machine learning techniques (e.g., support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, etc.) and deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), etc.) have been popularly applied into image recognition and time-series inferences for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). For instance, advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous cars have been developed based on machine learning and deep learning techniques to perform forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning systems, traffic sign recognition, traffic safety, infrastructure management and congestion, and so on. Autonomous cars can share their detected information (e.g., traffic signs, collision events, etc.) with other cars via vehicular communication systems (e.g., dedicated short range communication (DSRC), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), long-term evolution (LTE), and the 5th generation mobile networks) for cooperation. However, the performance and efficiency of these techniques are big challenges for performing real-time applications.</p>
<p>Therefore, several optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent algorithm, Adam optimization algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, etc.) have been proposed to support deep learning algorithms in finding faster solutions. For example, the gradient descent method is a popular optimization technique to quickly seek the optimized weight sets and filters of CNN for image recognition. The ITS applications based on these image recognition techniques (e.g., autonomous cars, augmented reality navigation systems, etc.) have gained more attention, and the hybrid approaches typical of mathematics for engineering and computer science (e.g. machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques) can be investigated and developed to support a variety of ITS applications.</p>
<p>The aim of this Special Issue is to focus on both original research and review articles on various disciplines of ITS applications, particularly machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for ITS time-series data analyses, ITS spatiotemporal data analyses, advanced traffic management systems, advanced traveler information systems, commercial vehicle operation systems, advanced vehicle control and safety systems, advanced public transportation services, emergency management services, electronic payment services, advanced information management services, information management services, vulnerable individual protection services, and other ITS applications.</p>
<p>Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for ITS time-series and spatiotemporal data analyses<br />
Machine learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques for advanced traffic management and safety, traveler information, commercial vehicle operation, advanced vehicle control and safety, and advanced public transportation systems<br />

**********************************************************************************</p>
<p>With the advancement of sensing, communications and networking, autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a vital role in a variety of areas, including healthcare, industry 4.0, smart farming and agriculture, logistics, transportation, and public safety. Together with the upcoming B5G/6G technologies, connected vehicular systems will become more ubiquitous and practical. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques can provide significant benefits towards automating the tasks of sensing, computing, and communicating in vehicular communication networks.</p>
<p>To achieve real-time perception and autonomous control, computing and communications in AI-enabled vehicular communication networks will be more complex and heterogeneous than before. Security and privacy will be extremely challenging, due to certain characteristics of these complex systems (high mobility of nodes and unreliable link connectivity) combined with vulnerable end devices, limited resources, and heterogeneous networking. For example, data collected from sensors for AI-based approaches pose new security threats. ML models trained at edge devices may suffer from various malicious attacks, but distributed ML algorithms are essential in vehicular communication networks with multiple self-organizing vehicles for control that is both scalable and low-latency.</p>
<p>The objective of this special issue is to bring together state-of-the-art innovations and research activities (from both academia and industry) to explore AI-based autonomous vehicular communication network technologies. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge learning in autonomous vehicular communication networks<br />
</li>
<li>Deep learning and distributed machine learning for vehicular communication networks<br />
</li>
<li>AI techniques for radio environment awareness in vehicular networks<br />
</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning for network decision making, network control, and management<br />
</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning for self-organized vehicular communication networks<br />

<li>Predictive QoS in autonomous vehicular communication networks<br />

<p>Special Issue on Federated Deep Learning-Empowered Internet of Vehicles</p>
<p>Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is designed to seamlessly connect smart vehicles, road infrastructures, communication facilities and users. The goal is to provide a comprehensive environment overview, improve transportation efficiency and reduce road accidents. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning, is essential for the progress of intelligent IoV. However, with the growing complexity of on-board sensors, the big raw data sets available for deep learning can give rise to concerns over data security and privacy, as well as huge communication overheads.</p>
<p>Distributed machine learning among smart vehicles and edge-cloud entities based on federated deep learning (FDL) is helping to address these challenges. FDL allows a central server to cooperate with multiple clients to jointly train a machine learning model. Clients upload parameters of the trained model to the central server and keep their training data locally, thus significantly reducing the communication costs and the data privacy risks. Although FDL has great potential for intelligent IoV, further research is required in some areas. For example, the trade-off optimisation between Quality of Service (QoS) and energy consumption in intelligent IoV, the efficient design of learning models in FDL for different intelligent IoV problems, communication efficiency for heterogeneous IoV technologies, and the security and privacy issues related to FDL under the dynamic IoV environment.</p>
<p>The objective of this special issue is to assemble high-quality research papers on emerging theories, frameworks, architectures and algorithms for solving the challenging problems related to FDL- empowered intelligent IoV. It will also offer an open platform for scholars and engineers to exchange their recent novel ideas and explore the potential convergence of existing intelligent IoV systems and advanced FDL technologies.</p>

<p>Article Collection “Automatic Performance Management and Optimization on Large-scale Heterogeneous Clusters”<br />
Frontiers in Big Data Journal<br />

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern industrial, government, and academic organizations are collecting massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale and pace, which are then analysed on large compute clusters in order to extract value and deep insights. These insights can drive automated processes for advertisement placement, improve customer relationship management, and lead to major scientific breakthroughs. Ensuring good and robust system performance at such a scale is the foundation for successfully performing timely and cost-effective analytics. However, as the new systems have grown in scale and complexity, the administration and management of system resources have become very expensive with the human factor dominating the total cost of ownership. To make matters worse, computing clusters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous in nature, both in the compute and the storage tier. Heterogeneity, if not addressed appropriately, is shown to have detrimental effects on the overall system performance.</p>
<p>As organizations often own multiple generations of hardware and data centres are starting to use virtualization to consolidate servers, heterogeneous environments are becoming common in practice. Computing-wise, nodes can have CPUs with different capacities and number of cores, making performance-based resource allocation and workload scheduling extremely important and challenging. In addition, the presence of GPUs and FPGAs on modern clusters has inspired their use by various big data frameworks. On the storage front, cluster nodes can have multiple hard drives, SSDs, and large memory, all of different sizes, while emerging storage technologies (e.g., NVMe, SCM) are becoming more popular. At the same time, applications exhibit a variety of I/O patterns: batch-processing applications care about raw sequential throughput, interactive query processing benefits from lower latency storage media, whereas other applications display random I/O patterns. Hence, it is desirable to have a variety of storage types and let each application choose the one that best fits its performance or cost requirements. Administrators and systems will need mechanisms to manage the fair distribution of scarce storage resources across all users, ideally in an automated manner. The goal of this article collection is to report recent advances in automating (fully or partially) any aspects of resource management and performance optimization in the presence of heterogeneous cluster environments.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>

<h1 id="scope">Scope:</h1>
<p>In the last decade, a huge amount of research contributions have been<br />
proposed in the scientific<br />
community in the field of mobile communications, aimed especially at<br />
enhancing the quality of service<br />
or experience (QoS or QoE) perceived by mobile hosts. Mobile computing,<br />
especially in 5G, has been<br />
proven to offer many advantages (such as flexibility and robustness),<br />
but at the same time, different<br />
issues arise when QoS/QoE need to be guaranteed. It is well known, for<br />
example, that user mobility<br />
affects channel conditions (Doppler and fast/slow fading degradations,<br />
strictly related to the average<br />
speed) or blocking/dropping probability performance (when users move<br />
among different coverage areas<br />
in infrastructure networks, the available resources could be scarce).<br />
Traffic flowing may be also<br />
affected, with dynamic congestion levels and huge fluctuations in<br />
relevant QoS/QoE parameters, such as<br />
throughput, e2e-delay, jitter, packet-loss, etc. Similar problems arise<br />
also in distributed<br />
environments, where topology changes are frequent and routing protocols<br />
suffer high overheads for new<br />
path rearrangements.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at dealing with the issues above, providing<br />
a point of interest for the<br />
discussion and presentation of theoretical models, simulation approaches<br />
or a mixture of them,<br />
regarding the world of the mobile computing paradigm. The development of<br />
theoretical models regarding<br />
different OSI-layers has been showing relevant results in recent years,<br />
especially if predictive<br />
approaches are involved. This Special Issue is soliciting original<br />
quality and high-level technical<br />
papers addressing the main research challenges in QoE-aware mobile<br />
networking, via the introduction of<br />
new models and simulations based on emerging approaches, such as swarm<br />
intelligence, evolutionary<br />
genetics, neural networks, artificial intelligence, cellular automata, etc.</p>
<p>The interest of this Special Issue is focused on, but not limited to,<br />
the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>Mobility patterns analysis by synthetic or realistic models;<br />
Innovative modelling techniques for communication systems, and their<br />
execution using optimized simulation algorithms;<br />
Simulation of wireless channel dynamics in new generation networks;<br />
Aerial drone object tracking through predictive models and simulations;<br />
Complex systems and networks;<br />
Congestion and admission control in wireless networks;<br />
Mobility management and congestion avoidance in vehicular environments;<br />
New tools and prediction techniques for measuring and monitoring mobile<br />
networks;<br />
Development of new simulation engines for communication systems with<br />
mobile nodes;<br />
Performance evaluation of mobile networks;<br />
QoS/QoE and models for predictive routing;<br />
Simulation of mobile network structures;<br />
Traffic analysis in mobile networks and modeling of performance metrics;<br />
Modelling of telecommunication systems by taking into account user mobility.</p>

<p>===========================</p>
<p>The organizing team is closely monitoring the development of the COVID-19 situation. In case of travel restrictions that prohibit physical attendance, the conference will be held in an alternative way using distance presentations in order to ensure both the safety of participants and wide dissemination.</p>
<p>===========================</p>
<p>Aims and Scope</p>
<p>Nowadays, the global vision is the progressive migration towards smart cities in order to enhance the citizen life and to encounter many problems induced by population growth and increased urbanization, such as traffic congestion, air pollution, … These smart environments can be viewed as interconnection of wide-scale cyber-physical systems, with sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators to collect diverse information from the surrounding environment and with actuators dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. Through such systems, many innovative applications can be proposed in several fields of activity, such as smart living, smart mobility, smart economy, smart environment and smart governance. As the human factor is involved in many applications, verifying and proving the validity and correctness of protocols and applications are crucial steps before deployment, in addition to ensuring other paradigms such as scalability, energy saving, resource constraints, etc. In this context, several methods and approaches of Distributed Computing are exploited in software and hardware to propose new approaches able to support and analyse the huge amount of collected information and to deal with the control of these emerging networks.</p>
<p>The workshop aims to be a major forum for researchers and practitioners, interested in the design, development and evaluation of distributed systems, platforms and architectures for Cyber Physical Systems in the context of smart cities. Highlights of the workshop will include a high quality single-track technical program and an invited speaker.</p>

<p>IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing (TETC) seeks submissions for the upcoming special section on “To Be Safe and Dependable in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: Emerging Techniques for Trusted and Reliable Machine Learning”.</p>
<p>During the last decade, advances in areas such as convolutional neural networks, deep learning, and hardware accelerators have enabled the widespread and ubiquitous adoption of machine learning (ML) in real-world systems. This trend is expected to continue and expand in the coming years, leading to a world that depends heavily on ML-based systems.</p>
<p>To be safe and dependable in this new era of artificial intelligence, these innovative systems have to be reliable and secure. This poses many research challenges. For example, fault tolerance is commonly achieved by redundant design, but the implementation of deep neural networks is already challenging, so there is little room to add additional elements for fault tolerance. Similarly, understanding the vulnerabilities of advanced ML systems is a complex issue, as shown by recent attacks on image classification implementations. Therefore, it is essential to learn how to build ML systems that cannot be manipulated or corrupted by malicious attackers and that can operate reliably when its underlying hardware or software suffers from errors.</p>
<p>This special section is devoted to: 1) recent advances in techniques, algorithms, and implementations for error-tolerant ML systems and 2) trust/reliable aspects of ML systems and algorithms, including vulnerabilities, management, protection, and mitigation schemes. Original papers with substantial technical contribution are solicited on the following topics:</p>
<p>Design and analysis of trusted/reliable ML algorithms and systems<br />
Innovative computational paradigms for ML, such as approximate/stochastic computing<br />
Fault/error-tolerant ML systems and techniques<br />
Trust, dependability, reliability, and security in ML implementations<br />
Adversarial and related techniques for ML systems and algorithms<br />
Techniques for trustworthy ML inclusive of detection, mitigation, and defense<br />
Evaluation of ML for applications such as in safety-critical and secure systems</p>
<p>Schedule<br />
Deadline for submissions: October 15, 2021<br />
First decision (accept/reject/revise, tentative): January 15, 2022<br />
Submission of revised papers: March 15, 2022<br />
Notification of final decision (tentative): May 1, 2022<br />
Journal publication (tentative): second half of 2022</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines<br />
Submitted papers must include new significant research-based technical contributions in the scope of the journal. Purely theoretical, technological, or lacking methodological-and-generality papers are not suitable for this special section. The submissions must include clear evaluations of the proposed solutions (based on simulation and/or implementation results) and comparison to state-of-the-art solutions. Papers under review elsewhere are not acceptable for submission. Extended versions of published conference papers (to be included as part of the submission together with a summary of differences) are welcome but there must have at least 40% of new impacting technical/scientific material in the submitted journal version, and there should be less than 50% verbatim similarity level as reported by a tool (such as CrossRef). Guidelines concerning the submission process, LaTeX, and Word templates can be found on the Author Information page. While submitting through ScholarOne, please select this special-section option. As per TETC policies, only full-length papers (10-16 pages with technical material, double column – papers beyond 12 pages will be subject to MOPC, as per CS policies -) can be submitted to special sections. The bibliography should not exceed 45 items and each author’s bio should not exceed 150 words.</p>

<p>First International Workshop on<br />
Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures in the IoT Era (EAIoT’2021)<br />

<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and<br />
Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all<br />
perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and<br />
competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and<br />
non-functional practices. According to the International Data<br />
Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual<br />
growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion<br />
within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT<br />
devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the<br />
Internet by 2023.</p>
<p>To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design<br />
principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures<br />
are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into<br />
these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business,<br />
information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these<br />
foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open<br />
forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about<br />
the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of<br />
enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the<br />
lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to<br />
integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and<br />
deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a<br />
new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only<br />
a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources<br />
inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis,<br />
knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better<br />
understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new<br />
ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the<br />
competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial<br />
Intelligence (AI) trend.</p>
<p>Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that<br />
enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could<br />
undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these<br />
obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise<br />
architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT<br />
devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and<br />
privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational<br />
capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT<br />
in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.</p>
<p>Topics of Interest<br />
This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both<br />
disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise<br />
architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could<br />
capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of<br />
business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT.<br />

<p>Modern critical systems are pervasive and quite diversified in terms of scale, whether related to factories, utility infrastructures, vehicles or even UAVs. Nevertheless, regardless of their size or scope, such systems have one thing in common: a set of special requirements in terms of security and safety, which ultimately deem their classification as “critical”. This is due to the sensitive nature of the involved control processes and applications, whose malfunction, whether accidental or resulting of malicious intervention, may pose a significant risk to human lives, assets or essential services.</p>
<p>With the emergence of complex application scenarios, either new or evolved from existing ones, the distributed nature of such critical systems is quickly unfolding into a massive scale: smart grids have pushed infrastructure components such as smart meters and inverters up to the consumer’s doorstep; the creation of services for automated UAV airspace coordination, in the scope of collision avoidance frameworks; or even vehicular networks, whose emergence may help overcome many of today’s problems associated with sustainable and safe mobility, are just a few examples. Ensuring the reliable, secure and continuous operation of scenarios with such a scale will imply the adoption of data-driven approaches, capable of dealing with considerable amounts of information to support the dependable (semi)automated analysis and decision mechanisms such applications need to become unfeasible.</p>
<p>This Special Issue is aimed at representing the latest advances in data-driven and security and safety for critical applications, encompassing different application scenarios such as (but not limited to):<br />
• Data-driven cyber-security for critical infrastructures and essential services;<br />
• Vehicular networks and V2X scenarios;<br />
• 5G-assisted security and safety mechanisms;<br />
• UAV airspace coordination and navigation;<br />
• Industrial IoT safety and security applications;<br />
• Resiliency, stability and fast control algorithms for grids;<br />
• Algorithms and techniques for data-driven anomaly detection, for safety and security;</p>

<p>IEEE Access invites manuscript submissions in the area of Deep Learning for Internet of Things.</p>
<p>In recent years, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to detect and collect human and environment information (e.g. geo-information, weather information, bio-information, human behaviors, etc.) for a variety of intelligent services and applications. The three layers in IoT are the sensor, networking, and application layers; several techniques and standards (e.g. oneM2M, Open Connectivity Foundation, etc.) have been proposed and established for these three layers. For the sensor and networking layers, the rise of mobile technology advancements (e.g. wireless sensor networks, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, narrow band-IoT, etc.) has led to a new wave of machine-to-machine (M2M), machine-to-human (M2H), human-to-human (H2H), and human-to-machine (H2M) communications. For the application layer, the IoT techniques in several applications, including energy, enterprise, healthcare, public services, residency, retail, and transportation, have been designed and implemented to detect environmental changes and send instant updates to a cloud computing server farm via mobile communications and middleware for big data analyses. One of the perfect examples is that the vehicle on-board units can instantly detect and share information about the vehicle geolocation, speed, following distance, as well as gaps with other neighboring vehicles. Big data can be collected by IoT techniques and then analyzed by deep learning techniques for a variety of applications and services.</p>
<p>Deep learning techniques, e.g. neural network (NN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc., have been popularly applied into image recognition and time-series inference for IoT applications. Advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous cars, for instance, have been developed based on machine learning and deep learning techniques, which perform forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, traffic safety, infrastructure management and congestion, and so on. Autonomous cars can share their detected information, such as traffic signs, collision events, etc., with other cars via vehicular communication systems, e.g., dedicated short range communications (DSRC), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), long term evolution (LTE), and 5th generation mobile networks for cooperation. However, how to enhance the performance and efficiency of these deep learning techniques is one of the big challenges for implementing these real-time applications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), adaptive moment estimation algorithm (Adam), and Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam), have been proposed to support deep learning algorithms for faster solution searching; for example, the gradient descent method is a popular optimization technique to quickly seek the optimized weight sets and filters of CNN for image recognition. The IoT applications based on these image recognition techniques (autonomous cars, augmented reality navigation systems, etc.) have gained considerable attention, and the hybrid approaches typical of mathematics for engineering and computer science (deep learning and optimization techniques) can be investigated and developed to support a variety of IoT applications.</p>
