DEMO and POSTER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Submissions should be a two-page abstract/proposal that follows the IEEE
formatting guidelines: refer to the IEEE submission instructions for
details. There is no need for double-blind submissions (names,
affiliations, and email addresses are therefore required). Be as
specific as possible in describing what you will demonstrate or display
as poster or demo. In the submission, specify clearly whether you will
be presenting a poster or a demo (the latter can be accompanied by a
poster also). The demo/poster session will take place online. If a
demonstration requires special arrangements or additional equipment,
please detail it in the submission. All additional equipment/needs are
subject to budget approval. Abstracts of accepted demos/posters will be
included in the INFOCOM 2021 Proceedings. Accepted and presented
abstracts will be submitted to IEEE Xplore®.

Poster submissions should be made via EDAS using this link:
