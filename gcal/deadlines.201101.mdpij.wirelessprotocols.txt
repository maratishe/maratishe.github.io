We contacted you on 23 April 2020, regarding a Special Issue entitled "Protocols and Applications for Wireless Mobile Networks", to be published in the journal Electronics (ISSN 2079-9292, IF 1.764). Prof. Dr. Young-Joo Suh is serving as Guest Editor for this issue. Based on your expertise in this field, we think you could make an excellent contribution.

Mobile traffic has been increasing rapidly and diverse network applications have also been developed remarkably, which gives rise to new challenges in the protocols of the wireless mobile network. For example, various features that are impossible in the 4G network are added in the 5G network, so specialized protocols for the 5G network are required. [...]
