CALL FOR PAPERS
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all
perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and
competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and
non-functional practices. According to the International Data
Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion
within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT
devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the
Internet by 2023.

To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design
principles and foundations of organizations’ enterprise architectures
are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into
these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business,
information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these
foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open
forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about
the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of
enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the
lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to
integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and
deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a
new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only
a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources
inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis,
knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better
understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new
ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the
competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial
Intelligence (AI) trend.

Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that
enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could
undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these
obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise
architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT
devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and
privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational
capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT
in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.



Topics of Interest
This workshop constitutes an opportunity for researchers from both
disciplines enterprise computing (with focus on enterprise
architecture) and IoT technologies to discuss how enterprises could
capitalize on these technologies so, that, a new generation of
business processes could spread over the emergent network of IoT.
Topics for discussions include, but are not limited to:
•       Standards for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Enterprise architecture for Industry 4.0.
•       Data science for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Semantic technologies for IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Agentification of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Interoperability inside and between IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Guidelines and best practices for IoT-based enterprise architecture
•       Privacy, trust, and security of IoT-based enterprise architecture.
•       Context management and awareness for IoT-based enterprise architecture
•       Case studies related to IoT-based enterprise architecture.
