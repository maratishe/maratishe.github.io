NoF 2020

The 11th International Conference on Network of the Future
Virtual Conference


http://nof2020.dnac.org

********************************************************************************
Technically co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE ComSoc

All accepted & presented papers will be submitted for publication in IEEE Xplore



Demo Paper submission deadline: September 11, 2020


The  11th  International Conference on  Network of the Future ( NoF) is  inviting

authors to  submit demo paper  proposals in the area of  Future Internet design,

with emphasis on enabling and cutting-edge technologies from the perspectives of

specification,  design and  analysis related to  network of future architecture,

applications, services, management, implementation, scalability, standardization,

business  and legal  aspects, just to name a few.

The  conference  aims  at  providing  a  forum  for  researchers,  students, and

professionals  to  exchange ideas,  share  their experiences,  and discuss their

research results  around a single-track  of technical sessions  and a series  of

keynote speeches. The program will also include tutorials.



Initially planned in Bordeaux, France, NoF 2020 will run as a fully virtual web-

based event, due to the uncertainty raised by the Covid-19 pandemics.

*** Submission guidelines ***

*****************************
Prospective authors are invited to submit Demo proposals in the form of a 3-page

paper  in IEEE conference  double-column format, preferably incorporating a demo

system architecture  illustration.  The proposal should also  describe in detail

what NoF 2020 attendees  will experience during the demonstration.  The proposal

should indicate  the demo background, and further focus on the demo settings and

the application, possibly with visual outcomes  to highlight the interest of the

demo.

Authors are also encouraged to optionally include in the paper submission a link

that opens a quite short (1-3min) video illustrating the demo and its scope.



Demo papers must be submitted electronically through EDAS in PDF format only.

See https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=27007&track=103381



Demo papers will be  peer-reviewed and  accepted demo papers will be included in

the electronic conference proceedings provided to NoF 2020 attendees and will be

subsequently submitted to IEEE Xplore.



At least  one author  of each accepted demo proposal is required  to register to

NoF 2020 conference and present the demo at the scheduled demo session.
