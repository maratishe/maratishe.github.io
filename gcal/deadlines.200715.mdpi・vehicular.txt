MDPI Sensors - Special Issue
New Approaches for Services and Information Delivery over Novel Vehicular Networks

CALL FOR PAPERS
As a consequence of the improvement in the performance of onboard devices, the improvement in batteries, or the notorious increase in service demands, autonomous vehicles (such as unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, UAV, or UGV) have turned out to be flexible multi-mission multi-sensorized network platforms with autonomous inter-connection capabilities. They can be linked using multi-hop networks naturally evolving the traditional concept of MANETs (mobile ad hoc networks) into FANETs (flying mobile ad hoc networks) or VANETs (vehicular mobile ad hoc networks), with new requirements and challenges.

On top of these interconnection facilities, new enabling technologies, such as NFV or SDN, are evolving towards flexible service provisioning scenarios, where virtualization and softwarization paradigms have been radically adopted, and new promising use-cases are emerging day in and day out, facilitating service and information delivery in many different areas over heterogeneous networking environments.

Reviews, original research articles, and practical experiences will be published. Reviews should provide an up-to-date, well-balanced overview of the current state-of-the-art, and include the main results from different research groups.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
+ Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
+ Mobile/vehicular/flying ad hoc networks (MANET/VANET/FANET)
+ Network functions virtualization (NFV)
+ Software defined networking (SDN)
+ Internet of things (IoT)
+ Data-centric approaches, e.g., the data distribution service (DDS)
+ Application/transport/network layer protocols in MANET, VANET, and FANET environments
+ Enablers for lightweight virtual network functions

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission Deadline: 15 July 2020. 
Papers are published upon acceptance, regardless of the Special Issue publication date.
