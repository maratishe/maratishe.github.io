Critical Infrastructures are defined as “assets, systems or part thereof which are essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact as a result of the failure to maintain those functions.” Critical Infrastructures refer to a multitude of sectors, including energy, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare and public safety. Systems deployed within these sectors integrate both information technologies and operational technologies, being commonly reliant on legacy industrial control and cyber-physical systems. Nevertheless, novel disruptive and enabling information and communication technologies are increasingly integrated, increasing connectivity and interdependencies, thus presenting security professionals with significant challenges in maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of such infrastructures. This Special Issue invites submissions that present innovative ideas, proof of concepts, use cases, and results from a variety of topics relevant to critical infrastructure cybersecurity and resilience, including (but not limited to) the following ones:

Security Governance

Security policies
Risk analysis and management
Vulnerability assessment and metrics
Awareness, training, and simulation
ICS/CPS security standards
Privacy and Anonymity in ICS/CPS
System and Network Security

Threat modelling
Security architectures
Access control
Malware and cyber weapons
Intrusion detection and visualization
Defence in depth
Monitoring and real-time supervision
Applied cryptography
Perimeter security
Safety-security interactions
